To give some context I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S4, my wife has a Nexus 5, my older daughter has an IPhone, and my younger daughter has a Blu Studio 5.0 II (love that phone) I had been researching this phone since it was announced. So I was very excited to get it 2 days after ordering it via Amazon prime for only $218 shipped. When I got the phone I was a little scared because I could not get it to turn on right away as almost all other phones had been able to do out of the box. So I threw it on the charger for an hour and viola it boots right up... Just a dead battery, no big deal. (This may be what was wrong for others who gave this phone a bad review),So onto the phone, WOW, what a display! It is amazing... Very bright and the colors seem spot on to me. It is definitely brighter than the super AMOLED screen on the Samsung Galaxy S4. At the time KitKat was not yet available so after booting up I had to install the update to get the Google services to work. No big deal again... Took less than 10 minutes. Now that the KitKat OS update is available (yay!) This may be a moot point. Speaking of KitKat it became available a few days later. That install went very smooth... A small side note a SD card is required to install KitKat.,I would assume everyone who buys this phone will increase the factory 4 gig storage with a new SD card anyway.,Kitkat seems very, very good on this phone without any bugs *see update at end of review* that I have seen unlike when I upgraded to KitKat on my Galaxy S4...

(See update at bottom of review),http://www.amazon.com/BLU-Studio-5-0Ce-Unlocked-Black/product-reviews/B00MAHW9AA," on October 24, 2014","I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and usability of this phone.  The specs are pretty darn good, other than it's modest half-gig of RAM.  It is quite responsive, and the screen is pretty good as well.  The faults are noticeable, but certainly not deal breakers.  If you are looking for a good, new, unlocked Android smartphone for under $100, this is a great option.  I am using it with PureTalk GSM (ATT network), on a $10/month voice and text plan, and this has worked great.,Pros:,Thin and sleek,Fast processor,Fine call quality,Good external speaker,Nice big screen,Responsive UI,Good WiFi and cell reception,Dual SIM,Includes screen protector,Good battery life.,LESS THAN $100!!!!,Cons:,Limited screen viewing angle,Limited RAM,Not HD/Retina resolution,No auto-brightness,No port covers (allows dust etc. into the phone),Tips:,There a couple things that you can do to ensure that this phone performs well despite it's shortcomings.  First, in developer options change ""Window Animation Scale"" and ""Transition Animation Scale""  from 1x to .5x.  This will allow the UI to scroll smoothly and remain more responsive even when background apps are running.  Turn on ""Force GPU Rendering"" in developer options as well to help with this.  Because of the limited RAM it may also be beneficial to get an App Cache cleaner, and limit the number of things allowed to run in the background in the developer options.,Update: 10/26/14,8 days after I received this phone, and 2 days after I reviewed it, it failed on me.  The screen started flashing scrambled colored lines, and became unusable.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41e0RDOtCRL._SY300_.jpg,"BLU Studio 5.0Ce Unlocked Phone, 4 GB, Black"

It came with everything, including the earphones, case etc. I was surprised by the size of the phone, which I also liked because my old phone had a screen display of 4.5"".

My verdict... It's not a bad device, Mind you for around $100, its not that bad.The local phone shops are selling these phones for twice this.,I do have a few grips though.,So my first complaint is the screen... yeah it's pretty bad.,Resolution aside, knowing I was getting a lower resolution device (basically 480P kind of resolution) I wasn't too upset with that, but yeah it's bad.,The viewing angle is where the issue is, if you're not looking at it dead on, the image looks like the typical ""old school"",LCD, where the colors are inverted, but the image quality even dead on is kind of washed out,,but the touch screen is really where this phone wins no love with me. It seems as if the sensitivity could have been tweaked,a little, but there is no way to adjust that in the menus. Also, again with the angle of view if you are trying to complete an action,with the touch screen, and the viewing angle is not dead on, then you're not activating the proper buttons on screen... and that damned back button! Sometimes it just wont work...,This complaint is a short one, but it's the front camera, the resolution is horrible, especially if the light is indoor.,I also have to report that the sound through the earphone jack is not great, there is just no bass, I have heard equal sound,quality from those cheap radios they give away for contests, and such.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41e0RDOtCRL._SY300_.jpg,"BLU Studio 5.0Ce Unlocked Phone, 4 GB, Black"

I can use my favorite android apps on it, mostly things like pandora, ebay, bank apps, netflix, etc. I also have a good habit of closing unused app and using memory optimization techniques, which helps to keep this phone performing at its best. Battery last about a full day, average for an android phone. Is it the fastest phone out there? No, but its only 80-something bucks! Is the sound/camera quality top notch? No, but its only 80-something bucks! Look, the bottom line is if you're just looking for a decent android phone with value for money as top priority, you need to look no further, this is it. Oh, did I mention it has DUAL sim slots? YES, you can have two numbers on this phone, it is incredibly useful for travelers and frugal business people with multiple phone numbers.

I've owned 2 samsungs, the last was a galaxy y duos which had 2 sim slots and I figured it out without any issues. I actually read the manual for this phone while waiting for the battery to charge up. The beginning part is spanish but if  you keep going through to the last 3rd of the manual, it's all in english so no need to panic. I can't compare with my galaxy y as it was a much older phone with different specs.,Pros:,Cheap, costs less than 90 bucks,Faster processor, chrome works as fast as a computer and i'm a cheap t-mobile network.,it's not bulky, has android 4.4,has about 2.35gb available for storage and allows up to 64gb sd card.,initial set-up is easy, it asks you to enter a name, connect to wifi and voila, you're in.,It also identified my network easily  with the sim inserted,It comes with a screen protector, case and the charger that doubles up as a usb connector for a computer as well as connect to the ac plug,It reached a 100% charge fairly easily,it's got a nice bright screen which is perfect for reading,It allows you to hit play and pause a song without swyping the screen.,came well packaged in a niche box and well arranged.,Cons:,This phone is a battery hog! What are the 4+ star reviewers talking about?! take a look at the lower rated reviews. I charged to 100% (as stated in the manual), made a 45minute call, and 2 calls lasting less than 30secs (just left messages), played music on a 12 minute drive,  had the wi-fi turned off after the first hour and this thing was at 32% battery in 3hrs and 29minutes on the battery.

I use it on a T Mobile network and it runs on its 4G network with great speed right after setup.  As far as performance and setup go, it is a great phone at a bargain price.  The screen renders a gorgeous display, videos run at a smooth frame rates, but the camera needs an upgrade.  It has no junk apps and I was able to install only those apps I wanted.  Setup was a breeze, even easier than my other T Mobile phones.  The processor is slow but it does the job.  Memory is only 512MB, which is below the requirement for Android 4.4(1GB Minimum), but it still runs.  Just make sure you close one app before using another.  The battery could be bigger capacity; It comes with a 1700 mAH battery, but it can still do three days of standby on a single charge.  If you use your phone a lot then you may need to charge everyday.  Let me tell you, this phone takes a long time to charge.  On the other hand, this phones does have a decent call quality, dual sim slots, selection of several colors, and at 80 dollars, they even give you a pouch and a screen protector, what more could anyone ask.,I do, however, have an issue with my phone and I hope I am the only one.  I noticed the left side of my phone was deformed when I was looking at it from the side way.  The side panel ridges out and there is a line of opening between the front display panel and the side panel.  In fact, most of the phone's left side panel is unevenly curved both horizontally and vertically.  When the phone is enclosed in the companion pouch, it is not visible.

So I have nothing to lose by giving a true review of this phone.,I've owned a lot of phones over the years, but I've got to say this one was the best deal on a great phones since ""Cellular"" companies gave you phones for free. I bought this for my 17 year old, quite frankly because I wouldn't feel that bad if he lost, broke, or bricked a $149 phone. When the price dropped to $99, it became an even better deal.,I've kept an eye on BLU phones for a while now, and while they seemed OK, it was clear that almost every one of their models gives something up in the interest of keeping the price low or focusing on a different shiny new object. Either you had to settle for a bad screen, no 4G, certainly no LTE in most cases, or something that was actually important. The Life One really doesn't seem to do that and has the kind of specs that a flagship phone would have had just a couple of years ago. In short, this is an amazing piece of technology at an unbelievable price.,We have a Family Share plan on AT&T, and all we had to do was slip in the SIM card and the SD card (you'd be foolish not to put an SD card into this phone) and we were off to the races. Turned t on and setup was a breeze, since my son had come from a feature phone, I had to make a call to AT&T to provision the phone for 4G LTE, but that took only about 10 minutes. I don't think you'd have to do that if your SIM card already was tied to a smartphone. The phone found WiFi, latched on to a strong 4G LTE signal, and showed a strong signal for calling, even stronger than my two year old LG Optimus G Pro.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410m0OfMWEL._SY300_.jpg,BLU Life One 4G LTE Smartphone -GSM Unlocked - Black

There were some sacrifices made by BLU in order to achieve the price, which means this phone is not for everyone.,In my opinion this phone is perfect for anyone who does not want to be stuck in and contract and does not plan to install many apps or play more graphic intensive games.  The phone is good for using the Internet, taking pictures as long as you are using a microsd card, making phone calls, and a lighter usage of apps.,I rated this phone 4 stars. The rating based on the criteria I have listed.,I have tested this phone on both at&t and T-Mobile networks.  I am including screenshots in my review. Feel free to ask questions in the comments field and I will try to answer them.,CONS,- Device Storage: This is my biggest CON.  The cost difference between 8GB and 16GB NAND Flash is minimal. The company should have gone with 16GB even if they decided to slightly increase the cost of the phone. Considering the Android OS take up a good portion of the storage, which will be worse with Lollipop once upgrade later this year.  Yes you can add a Microsd card but many apps cannot be move to the MicroSD card.,- RAM:  1GB of RAM limits the amount of multitasking you can perform without suffering from stuttering.,- Shipping with KitKat rather than Lollipop does not make much sense with a new phone.,- Missing BAND 5 (at&t) and BAND 12 (T-Mobile) LTE Bands.

I have been on this quest for years as I am always never without my mp3 player or radio.  I am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly.  So I am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (Skullcandy Ink'd).  This time, after carefully reading reviews, I purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range (Under $15.00): The Panasonic RP-HJE120-A (Blue), The Skullcandy Jib, and The 2XL Spoke (Bounty Hunter Collection). My conclusions were that the 2XL Spoke were adequate, but a distant third place. While the 2XL had definitively better bass than the Skullcandy Ink'd, the 2XL's mids and highs were only adequate.  The Skullcandy Jib completely blew the Scullcandy Ink'd away, with much better bass, mids and highs, I thought I found what I had been looking for, that my quest had ended.  But there was still the Panasonic RP-HJE120 to listen to.  I must say I had little expectation for these after listening to the Skullcandy Jib's.  But what was this?  Immediately the Panasonic's sounded impressive.  After listening to them for a while, I listened to the Jib's again.  I honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the Panasonic RP-HJE120, and the Ergo design was a plus, the fit was just so comfortable. So there you have my layman's evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the Panasonic RP-HJE120 (I got the Blue, however, I very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound). I hope this helped.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3122Iz%2B1EWL._SX300_.jpg,"Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue"

If that's how you wear them,  you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies.  It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.,Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound absolutely horrendous.,Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm quite certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.,As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound great.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3122Iz%2B1EWL._SX300_.jpg,"Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue"

My friend says they are much more durable than the other $10 headphones she's had in the past; very sturdy for the price. The only thing me and her were concerned about was how the silicone buds are slightly flimsy, but, then again, these ARE only $10. But for $10, you couldn't find a better pair of headphones. UPDATE: I have gone through 2 pairs of these things since I first bought them. I washed my 1st pair, & went awhile without another pair like this. When I ordered my second pair, I realized again what I had been missing. The bass isn't as full as my   in-ears, & the mids aren't as detailed either, but it's not like they are far off. The treble is richer, however. And these things can stand a lot of abuse. As long as the beating is not too intense, the only real reason you would buy another pair is because you lost them.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3122Iz%2B1EWL._SX300_.jpg,"Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue"

The quality wasn't great, so I returned it and used the money to buy this case ($11.99) and the Fintie case ($10.99). These are the two most popular cases on Amazon, and I couldnt tell based on reviews and pictures which one is better. Now that I have them both.....I'm glad I have both! These cases are both great for being so cheap. Once one case wears out I will pop in the the other one and hardly notice a difference. Both cases are light and sleek, but I will point out the highlights of each case to help people that only want to purchase one JETech: -Smooth confortable shell back that adds Very little thickness to the iPad -Sturdy but flexible cover that holds up very well in both typing positions -a tiny bit thinner when compared to Fintie case, but barely noticeable when side to side Note: the cover sticks out a little farther than the actual iPad. Some people might get bugged by this, but I dont think it is a problem and if anything adds more cushion when dropped Fintie case: -Plastic railing over the speaker at bottom of iPad for extra protection -More of a leather look that gives the cheap case a more classy look Overall, I really like both cases. Instead of buying an Apple case for $80, I feel confident with either case that I saved a bunch of money but im still protecting my iPad well.

The JETech looks just like the Apple Smart Case; the materials seem the same and the cover folds the same way. BUT the JETech is smaller. Whereas the Apple case's bottom extends about 1/4 inch beyond the iPad body with a lip, the JETech bottom just snaps on. So the Apple case gives more protection to the edges of the iPad, but at the cost of a larger footprint.

They were all new. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 (SG4.) The charging speed is great. The charge percentage increases when I'm using the phone. With my old cable it did the opposite which is why I purchased new cables. There's just one issue. All 3 came with a missing metal pin. If you look at the small end of the cable there's 5 metal pins inside. 1 metal pin is missing from all 3 I purchased which is not a big deal for the average users but a huge deal for us who are into battery usage and stuff. Wish I could get a FULL refund. Yes it still charges but not at its full rate hence the missing pins. I wouldn't recommend. Just buy an original from the Samsung website.

SOMETHING always needs a charge, and the chargers included with most phones can take 2, perhaps 3 hours for a full charge. The iClever has 2 separate 2.4 amp outlets,  ending the debate of ""Who's phone is lower?"" without running more cords into the living room, or leaving our phones in a separate room to charge. The LED illumination  is a nice touch if you need to locate the charger in the dark.

The weight is distributed evenly throughout the square design. Cons: 1. Nothing that I noticed. Additional Comments: 1. It is a nice premium sleek dual usb charger.

The diameter of the plug ends where the cable is connected is twice as large as the cable it was made with, suggesting that the thin cable was not the cable that it was designed to be built with.  The factory that is making the 3' black cables is cutting costs and producing a product that is less durable than other variants of this cable.

Since I no longer need a huge bag to haul my new system, I tried two other bags...then, I found this bag. I am not kidding, this bag is absolutely perfect. It holds my Panasonic Lumix G series body with a pancake lens, two Lumix power zoom lenses, filters and has just enough room left for another small camera like a superzoom. It is extremely well padded with adjustable compartments. There is plenty of secure extra storage for a phone, extra batteries, charger, etc. There is even a padded place for an iPad. The bag is easy to open with one hand and sits flat on it's bottom. It is perfect for the car. It sits well out of sight on the floorboard and when I need it, I can put it in the passenger seat and access everything I need without it slipping or sliding around like larger bags tend to do. If you want a top quality, incognito, camera bag look no further. Amazon hit a home run with this one. UPDATE: I have had the bag several months now and it still impresses me. There is nothing I would change about this ""five star"" bag. UPDATE: June 2015. Bag is holding up like a champ. No wear, nothing broken and hauling FIVE lenses and a camera body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DqBp1YYrL._SX300_.jpg,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Orange interior)

Here are my pros and cons. Pros 1. Spacious. It fits the camera, lens, cables, battery, and battery charger all in the main compartment. I have the manual in the front pocket and there are still 2 empty pockets for me to place other things. 2. Looks nice. The orange interior makes finding things easier (a black interior would make literally everything blend in) and the exterior is well made. 3. The main compartment has 2 straps, velcro, and a zipper. I feel like my stuff is safe. 4. I haven't seen any of the issues with straps that others have mentioned. Not calling them liars or anything, but maybe theirs should've been exchanged for one without those problems. 5. Comes with a second strap that's attached to the sides if you prefer to use that rather than the handle that's already there. 6. The main compartment is customizable. You can remove the dividers and place them where you want. I liked this a lot because it lets me space out the inside how I like. Cons 1. The main compartment takes a minute to get into. If you're forgetful like I am and have to get into the main compartment over and over again to get stuff you forget, this can get tedious. 2. You have to attach the straps to carry this bag by the handle. However, Pro #5 kind of cancels this out. Overall, if you're buying a DSLR and you don't have a billion lenses, this is a great purchase. Multiple ways to carry it, lots of space, nice colors and build quality. AmazonBasics is becoming more and more awesome and I'm glad I got this bag. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a camera, a couple of lenses, and a need for some extra space.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DqBp1YYrL._SX300_.jpg,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Orange interior)

However, the $24.99 that this is going for right now is still a great price.  Especially since this is so well built.  This is called a ""gadget"" bag, but it's really a DSLR camera bag.  This is great for your camera, your lenses, various batteries, a small tablet (like a Kindle) and probably a bunch of other stuff, but I ran out of camera things.  If you take the cushions out and leave it somewhere, you'll find that an 11 lb cat will fit in it, though he can't lay down.  But he will try.,Once you chase the cat out, if you don't want to put in a DLSR, you can fit a Kindle Paperwhite with a case, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 in a Quorky case, an Elph camera with a case, a Limeade Blaset 18000 mah with case, an EasyAcc 12000mah power bank (without a case, though I'm sure if it's not too big, you can include it), various charging plugs, a screen wipe, and a small thing of lotion.  If you take the internal cushioned separators out, you can put ,, a small bag of jerky, and a candy bar.  That's not even including the stuff you can put in the two side pockets and the front pocket.,All silliness aside, this is really well built.  The stitching is tight, the zippers run smooth, the sides are cushioned really well, and the things that are for separating your lenses and stuff are also good cushions.  This is small enough to shove under the airplane seat in front of you, even if you're flying cattle class, yet as long as the person in front doesn't lean back, you can pull it back out again to get your stuff while the plane is flying.,This is not TSA friendly, though.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DqBp1YYrL._SX300_.jpg,AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag (Orange interior)

It's definitely quite limited in what it can carry....but it does work for me in some situations. It *does* hold my Canon 40D with Tamron 18-270mm super-zoom attached along with my 540EX flash and a extra 50mm lens, so would be a reasonable bag for me to use on trips when I am not able to bring a selection of lenses with me. I am not a person that can carry much equipment with me in the field due to physical problems, so I really need a bag that is comfortable and can handle at least this amount of equipment. I do wish the interior dividers and velcro had a few more optional placements, you're pretty restricted in how they can be placed.,You'll find many, many interior compartments and stuff hidden away in this bag, including a nice rain cover for the camera on the inside, and for the entire bag on the outside. The tripod holder flap can be tucked inside, as well as the additional waist strap. There almost to me seem to be *too* many compartments. I don't need so many that I end up having to remember where I put what item and unzipping a dozen pockets to find it. But I'm sure a lot of photo geeks love that kind of thing.,While I do love the sling design in terms of it helping to relieve some of the weight that is so problematic for me, I do have to add that it's not the easiest (or most flattering) thing for many women to wear, particularly if you are, umm, well-endowed shall we say. I basically have to either push the strap up in which case it is practically strangling me, or move it slightly down which umm, pushes other things UP.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41imNSKItpL._SY300_.jpg,Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW

People who are getting started with digital SLRs, like the Canon Rebel series or the Nikon equivalents. More advanced photographers might want to look at the larger versions of the Slingshots. In fact, this will fit a Rebel T2i + 55-250mm lens and Canon 430EX flash - snuggly, but it will fit.,The bag itself, like most Lowepro products, is top notch. It feels solid and well constructed (which explains why it feels bulky.) There are enough small pockets to carry batteries, smaller filters and memory cards. The top compartment is good for holding lens hoods or any other smaller objects. The rain cover is on the bottom of the camera and easily flips over the camera in case of downpour.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41imNSKItpL._SY300_.jpg,Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW

In fact, I love this bag so much that even when I'm not bringing my SLR around, I still use this for other purposes. Here's why it's so great: -FUNCTION- Being able to swing the bag to the front is a huge benefit (the biggest reason for using a sling-style). I can get my camera out in about three seconds! The zippers are secure and the extra pockets are well thought-out, especially the small pockets for memory cards and battery on the part that flips open. There are several straps on the outside of the back for attaching various items. If you need a tripod, I would get the 102. -SIZE- I was going to get the 200 (there's also a 300), but I'm so glad I went with the 100. As an amateur, I don't want to carry around more than I have to. This bag is big enough for my 18-55, a zoom, and a prime. The inside padding can be reconfigured but even the as it came, it fits my camera with the 18-250 attached with no problem. -COMFORT- This is extremely comfortable. The weight of the contents is distributed nicely across my shoulder and I can have this on my back literally all day with no problem. This is part of the reason why the 100 might be perfect since you have no choice but to carry light! -DURABILITY- The bag seems very well made. Although I've only used it a few times so far, it looks like it will hold up. Zippers and straps are in great condition and there is nothing flimsy at all. -RECOMMENDATION- If you only need to carry the camera with a few accessories, this bag is perfect. This allows you to quickly access your camera while not needing to take anything off your body. It also doesn't scream ""hey everyone, I have an expensive camera in here!"" unlike some other camera bags.

As other reviewers have said, these toys grew black mold inside of them. We tried to never put them away wet, always squeezing them out after baths, but unfortunately it is IMPOSSIBLE to squeeze them out completely and they were filled with nasty mold after about 2 months. Even worse, the toys are not terribly transparent (some of them not at all) so you will not even know immediately that they are moldy. Until the mold grows to the point where you can clearly see because the toys which were more translucent have clouded you will not even be aware of it. Since the whole idea is to use them to squirt water or for our baby to handle and chew (which involves squeezing water out of them) this is almost sure to lead to your child ingesting mold spores.

Nothing worked so I searched on the internet for a way to clean them and no one had any viable ideas for cleaning these and it came down to the same thing everywhere I went ""Pitch Them!"",But my daughter LOVED them so I bought another set, this time determined to prevent the mold by squirting them out after each bath.

Even if they didn't grow mold, they are poorly designed because the squirt holes are in odd places where water doesn't easily squirt out of them.

He was really quite upset by how powerful the jet of water was, so I'd recommend caution when considering using these with really young babies. Now baby is in his 7th month, and becoming used to all sorts of new things, and he's quickly had a change of heart about these toys. They're small enough for him to hold, soft enough for him to manipulate them himself, and he really enjoys having the water squirted all about.

This requires the display to be used a lot. Display is a #1 power hog on any device, so I can go thru battery fairly fast. Since I like the thinness of my S3, I don't like to use the bulky extended batteries. Besides, it makes it difficult to use other accessories, such as cases, docks, etc. That led me to try various ""spare"" batteries, which are fairly tiny, and I can carry them around easily. I also like to use the NFC feature of my phone, one of the best new features with a very bright future - IMHO. I tried various batteries, and tested them for the obvious features like capacity, and the less obvious, such as the NFC embedded antenna. The Samsung OEM version is good, but it is also grossly overpriced; costing almost as much as a subsidized phone. Then there are the counterfeits with Samsung labels. The labels are great. Unfortunately the stuff under the labels doesn't function properly, and some of these can actually damage the phone, or worse, start a fire (BTW, there are FAA regulations on carrying Li-ion batteries on a plane). These Anker 2200mAh batteries with NFC are the best I found. As a nerd engineer, and I ran various test, which I will not bother you with. It is pretty boring to set up totally objective comparison test. The batteries currenly in the phone may have some wear on them, rechargeable batteries age and exactly same test environment is very difficult to establish, using the actual phone. My test results indicate that these Anker batteries are the best of the bunch, use them, enjoy your phone, and forget about performance, functionality or any support issues. These batteries and LaptopMate support are unmatched by anyone else I tried so far.

I don't have a lot of room there and need a lot of outlets - both AC and USB powered - and this tower is perfect in that space.  The top of the power has two buttons which turn on/off half of the outlets.  The AC outlets are well spaced out.  I am able to mount two large chargers next to each (see video), no outlets are blocked!  This is a very clever design.,The strip has a 6.5 foot cord and a regular size plug.,In addition to 8 AC outlets this tower also has 4 USB outlets.  I tested each USB port with a current monitor an Android device and an Apple device. I saw that it charged my Android phone at an optimal rate on each outlet.  iPadMini perfromed well at at optimal rate on one port (2A).  Performance on 2 others were typical for 1A port but not optimal for iPadMini, and one port delivered only USB level of performance.,To see how well different chargers and external batteries charge my mobile devices I use a Nexus phone and an iPadMini to test each of them. I do my tests with the devices charged to the same level, running the same applications and using the same cables to keep everything the same. This allows me to compare them to each other in a fair way. I use the current monitor to see what current is delivered to each device which tells me how well each external battery is working.,Samsung Nexus phone:,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,1 port: 1.02A/4.99V (excellent),2 port: 1.00A/5.01V (excellent),3 port: 0.99A/4.99V (excellent),4 port: 0.98A/5.01V (excellent),(for comparison the best charging monitor result for this phone is 1.00A/5V),iPad Mini tablet:,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,1 port: 0.93A/5.02V (average for 1A),2 port: 0.47A/4.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RyCibgfqL._SY300_.jpg,Smart 8-Outlet with 4-USB Output Surge Protection Power Strip (SAFEMORE)

The box on this item says the max USB output is 2.1A, which is more than the other reviewer found on any USB port.  Maybe the 2.1A are divided among the USB ports?  Cannot tell.  If some ports deliver less power than others, it would be nice to know which are the higher powered ones. Also, the there was no instruction flyer in the box.  The two buttons on top of the device are undocumented.  The other reviewer said the buttons turn on/off half the outlets.  I wonder.  There is supposed to be a built-in circuit breaker, so I would expect to find a reset button for the circuit breaker.  I find no such button, unless those two top buttons are actually the circuit breaker resets as well as or instead of on/off. And finally, there is not Underwriters Lab sticker on the power cord or anywhere else on the item. The form factor is very nice.  That's all I can say good about this item. Update:  I studied the item again, looking for a reset button.  I found a pushbutton just below the column of USB ports.  Maybe that is the surge protector overload reset button.  Maybe.

I currently have this power strip on the ground right next to my bed. I am able to charge my phone and use the wall sockets for many other devices such as my laptop and my lamp.,Going over the design of the power strip, it is made out of a plastic material and feel really durable and has a solid build to it. Going around the power strip, you will find 8 Wall Sockets and 4 USB Ports. There are several buttons on the power strip when you press the button it will turn the power on/off. When you are not using the socket you can simply press the button to cut off the power. The button is located on the top of the power strip. With it being on the top it is really easy to turn off and on instead of going around and looking for the button. When using the USB Ports, there is also a button that you can use to cut off the power.,When each of the buttons has been pressed there will be a LED indicator light that will tell you whether power is going through or not. On the top you will see Red LED lights while for the USB Port, you will find a bright Blue LED Light. So when you are using this in the middle of the night you will be able to see if power is going out or not.,The cord on the power strip is a 6 Foot cord, so you will be able to use this power strip at a distance. From where I am using it, the outlet is pretty far away but with power strip, I am able to reach it. There is plenty of cord in this power strip. One thing that I found about the cord is that it came with a weird smell to it. When I hold the cord, the smell will get onto my hands. But when I have it plugged into the wall I will not be touch it too much anymore.

I went to the local best buy to try the other two out and was surprised that such a loud sound came out of these little speakers.  So when I made the purchase of this speaker it had some big shoes to fill in the small speaker department.,When I received the speaker it came with a charge and paired to Bluetooth seamlessly.  When I play the speaker I noticed that the base response was a lot better than the other two I tried.  The speaker `s highs on the other hand are not as loud but since I play mainly hip hop and R&B this speakers sounds better to me than the other two in its size range.  Out of all three of the speakers I tried the JBL was louder but didn't have the base response I was looking for.  The philips sharpshooter was the least powerful out of the three and this one came in right behind the JBL clip but got my vote as the best speaker out of the three because of the bass response.,I have used this product all day while at work and it lasted the whole time.  I didn't turn it on until two hours into the shift then used it while cooking dinner. I have not pushed the speakers to the max when it comes to battery life but I know for sure it can handle more than eight hour easily. The stats say this speaker can last 15-20 hours so I will hardly every have to charge it.,The speaker is the size of a normal fist and comes with a nice carrying case.

I own the cylinder shaped speaker listed here as well, but I will say that the new cube model is just as loud, but with less distortion at a higher volume. It has a much richer, fuller sound and the bass actually plays out very well without any cracking. Aesthetically, the new cube model is really appealing. It's slightly heavier (likely due to much bigger battery), but has a very pleasing soft-touch material that looks and feels very nice. Another perk is that the bluetooth light is small and easily covered if it bothers you. The cylinder model has an intermittently blinking LED that fully encompasses the unit, so it's a 360 degree light that can get distracting in a dark room. Unlike a lot of the newer bluetooth speakers, the cube model does not have the annoying voice announcing every time you pair it or that the battery is low, this is something I appreciate. The bluetooth range on the cube model is really an upgrade. I couldn't walk from my living room to the kitchen without the sound cutting out on the cylinder model, but the cube let's me walk 3 rooms away without losing audio! And lastly, one of the big reasons for me upgrading is the battery life. I've yet to see another speaker offer 18-20 hours worth of sound, and at the same price as the previous model it was a no brainer. I like being able to take the speaker to the river or on a long hiking trip without having to give much thought to the battery life, and this speaker lets you do that. In my opinion, the new cube speaker trumps the cylinder model (and most bluetooth speakers in general under $75) in all the ways that are important to me (aesthetics, battery life, sound).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wTBxoNfiL._SY300_.jpg,"Anker Classic Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 20 Hour Battery Life and Full, High-Def Sound for iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Nexus, HTC, Nokia and More(Black)"

Amazing. I really didn't know what I was expecting But I guess I basically had low expectations for this guy especially after opening him. It's not the biggest But it's a decent size. When I lifted it up it had some weight to it But still of course no idea what the doing would be like. So connecting it and everything is pretty simple and without using the manual I figured out all the buttons pretty easily. Now before I even get to sound quality How loud can this guy go? Well I use it with my lg g3 and id say pretty loud, I can turn it up all the way and hear it from the top floor of my house and hear it slightly But still hear it in the basement. When I take it to my high-school at lunch, at full volume in a crowded cafeteria with at least 750 students all talking yelling and what not. It's not the clearest But you still hear this speaker, I do wish I could be a bit louder But if your alone this guy will blow you away. Honestly you never need to go to Max volume unless your in a crowded environment like I was. So finally the anticipated sound quality. This is unbelievable. It's like listening to headphones But out loud. You clearly hear highs, clear mids and that bass is to die for. It's sound quality is on par or even a bit better than by Sol Republic HD -Track speakers Which I paid $80 for (honestly that might have been a little exaggerated But definitely this sound is up there no doubt).

Item arrived within promised time period. Opened and started a song on my computer from my ITunes library. Using my Bluetooth App, this speaker was easily identified and paired. Connecting was attempted but failed. I watched the progress bar as the connection attempts went on. After two or three minutes, I shut everything down and repeated the process which produced the same result. I then called the phone number given in the instruction manual that came with the speaker and got an unusual response ! An auto- mated recorded voice came on and without giving a corporate identification, instructed me to leave my name and phone number and that ""xxxxxxxx"" (a six to eight digit number) would respond. Thus a unidentified voice was turning my problem over to a person ( i assumed ) who only answered to a number, not a name. This did not inspire confidence !

The replacement arrived promptly and shortly thereafter was providing me excellent music as reflecting the expressions of the numerous 5 star reviews this speaker earned. I am giving it 4 Stars only based on the initial experience with the first unit.

I purchased them before and was pretty upset that the non-Apple cables just didn't work and it says so when I plugged it into my iPhone.  I went to Apple and paid $21 for a half-meter cord.  So here comes the ZeroLemon cable to the rescue, albeit a 10' black cable. I ran it through the usual tests: charging, downloading, uploading, synching and all of that.  Then I did some not-so-usual tests: yanking, pulling, bending, creasing, smashing in a car door, etc., not that these things would actually happen to a cable.  However, the ZeroLemon cable performed perfectly.,The cable itself is thicker and appears more durable than the Apple white.  Also, the plastic surrounding the plug is just a bit bigger and this may be an issue for those with cases that would only fit the Apple white plug. This isn't a problem for me since my case does not cover the bottom.  It may be a problem if your current Apple white cable along with a case fits just right. (See pictures #11 & #12),I've contacted TechArmor regarding their cases and the larger plug ends. TeacArmor stated that their cases are designed to handle the larger plugs for the non-Apple accessories and this is quite a relief since the Apple cables are just so darn expensive. It seems that most cases made today are accommodating the larger plug.,The other benefit is that the cable is black. I know that Apple likes the white cable but it just screems ""Hey, look at me. I'm attached to a really valuable Apple device that everyone in the world would want so come and take me.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tBjmaO7UL._SY300_.jpg,"[Apple Mfi Certified] / Zerolemon® Lightning to USB Data and Charge Cable/ 3m for Iphone 6 (4.7) / Plus (5.5) /5s / 5c / 5, Ipad Air / Mini / Mini2 / Ipad Air / Ipad 4th Generation, Ipod 5th Generation, and Ipod Nano 7th Generation [2 Year Warranty] - White"

The plugs seat securely into my charger and iPhone 5S, too.  I have a Case Logic rubber case   on my iPhone, and the cord fits just fine. The cord is 10' long -- that's longer than any of my other cords, and will come in handy for those times when I need to recharge from a plug that's not nearby.

Yes, three times as long as Apple's. When Apple brought out the cable and did not authorize anyone else to build it, they have forced us to adapt to the length constraint. I guess the relief from such a constraint was the biggest shock. I have requested the black version and here's what I found in my little research:,PROs:,* the end plugs seem sturdy enough and well attached to the cable to take on the real world. I've tried to tamper with the lightning end of the cable a little bit, bend it way over its normal use pattern. No damage to the plug, though I noticed the Lightning plug actually bends. The bulky plastic end actually bends a little. I am pretty sure there is an electronics PCB in there, but it survived my fury. The USB end of the cable handled similarly, with no visible damage after bending its cable to the extreme.,* cheaply priced, not cheaply made. Yes, this one is very well built and three times longer than my other cables.,CONs:,* the Lightning plug is bulkier than Apple's, clocking in at approx. 11mm (wide) x 6mm (thick) x 17mm (long). Apple's is approx. 7.5mm (wide) x 4mm (thick) x 12mm (long). This may create issues with some phone cases that are tight around the Lightning connector. This plug, however, is slimmer than that of the AmazonBasics cable I have reviewed previously.,Neutral:,* length is 3 times the normal length of Apple's cable. At 10ft, it is a little bit too big to carry around with you - with the cable being thicker and longer, the volume this cable takes is a bit larger than your typical Apple cable. However, this will serve well to charge my phone while I lay down in bed.

I was not required to write a positive review and I do not rate products higher than they should have been. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's requirements. I recently received an iXCC 3 port USB car charger for a product review. The charger itself was actually a bit smaller than two other car chargers I have recently reviewed (one was 2 port the other 3 port) so that was a plus. The charger is rated to support 2.4A per port with a total output of 7.2A which is pretty good, should be more than enough unless you charge multiple tablets with this adapter. For my real world test, I have been using it in my car where I often have 3 devices connected - Moto X smartphone, Nexus 7 tablet and a bluetooth receiver.  I haven’t had any problems supporting all of those devices. Here are the main points I noticed about this product: Design: The adapter is smaller than two other multiple port USB chargers I have tested, and comes in multiple colors.  The silver one I got looks nice. Output Rating: Considering this charger is rated at 2.4A per port with a total of 7.2A for the device, it should have no problem supporting multiple power hungry devices.

Of course, I wouldn't recommend using CHEAP computer speakers, as in, computer speakers that use the power from the computer to power them.  That would probably break your TV.  Mine were a bit nicer, and had a small subwoofer and had to have it's own power source (ie. a Power cable),The only problem is that this TV is unlike my old one, which had the capability to have computer speakers hook directly into one of the 'audio outputs' on the back of the TV, so I could control the volume using the TV remote.  On this TV (and many others, I assume), by using this converter, my TV thinks that the audio is a separate device with it's own remote.,Downside: I have to get up every time I want to turn up/down the TV.

So I bought these to get around that problem and they work very well. One problem though is that it exchanges my left earphone for my right, but I just switch the colors around (red in white and white in red). Some helpful advice: 1. Your tv has to have red and white ""audio out"" ports (usually in the back) 2. Like me, you may need a headphone extension cord. My headphones are a little short so my face is 2 feet away from the tv screen. 3. Many of you may run into a little problem where sound is coming from both the headphones and the tv which kinda defeats the purpose of the headphones. My solution was to turn the tv sound all the way down while the headphones were still plugged in. For some reason the sound for the tv speakers go down but not the headphones.

They're expensive, but they work, as you would expect from the manufacturer. One of the major issues we had with the original was how quickly the pail begins to stink. It probably can't be helped, considering what you're putting in there on a daily basis. Despite attempts to use Lysol cleaner, even scrubbing out the diaper genie, that smell still seems to be there. We were hoping these refills might help counteract that to some extent. No go there, unfortunately. Doubt anything could at this stage though. Initial thoughts were that they appeared to be thinner than the originals. Sometimes the originals would even rip, although, we haven't yet experienced that with these refills. The price is definitely a plus, and we're thrilled that we will have so many to last. We previously went through a regular refill in about 2 weeks. These have lasted about the same amount of time, thankfully. So.. Cheaper, despite appearing to be lower quality they seem to be fine, last about the same amount of time, and you get more.

They arrived and they fit in the genie- awesome! The issue is that the plastic is thinner than the traditional genie refills. I didn't have any issues with ripping- the problem that the thinness caused is that the plastic slips down too quickly in the genie. Basically, I'd end up with a bag that would have a diaper, long space, then another diaper, and so on. When the genie was full, I'd have to shake this bag full of diapers to get them all to settle together and then decide where to snip off the plastic and tie. And when there are blowout diapers (which is often now that my son is experimenting with solids), it just wasn't worth the mess and effort to save the bag. I think that I ended up being able to dispose of less diapers in these 4 refills than I normally would in 3 refills of the traditional diaper genie bags.

That issue being that there's no marker towards the end of the bags. The DG liners have a black line to warn you that you are near the end. This is helpful so that you can gauge when to cut the liner and form another bag (if you can) or to just tie it off and toss the remaining end. Other than that they contain the smell (we have three in diapers) and allow the jaws and lid to close just as the original liners do. Not sure why another review mentioned that the lid didn't go down - sometimes that happens with the originals as well. I am buying again as long as they remain a deal and we have little people in diapers. A tip to those complaining about the bag pulling all the way out or too fast - keep the plastic ring that you are supposed to remove ON - this helps slow the bag usage excess.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E15N0IqrL._SY300_.jpg,"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie, 272 Count, Pack of 4"

We tested a few other laptops to make sure it was the VGA cable going into the monitor and the couple of laptops we tested were fine.  This is the second mini display port adapter I purchased (two different manufacturers) and both failed after very little usage.  I suspect one of the reasons is the short mini display port cord.

They're well made, and the price is usually really good. No exception here. You can get a lot of cheap Cat-6 cables, but I've found off brand cables to be hit and miss sometimes. Often, you get cables with thin casing, which doesn't offer much protection, and when the fibers of the cable breaks, you have to replace it. The casing on this model is great. It's not the thickest, most rugged cable I've ever seen, but it's at least average. Plus, Amazon ships it in ""frustration free"" packaging, which makes it easy to open.

When I first connected it to my Mac via the included USB cable, it auto launched an install program and I installed two really useful programs:  One was the driver, while the other pulls up a browser window to the web-based setup controls, which included monitoring how much data is used each session*.  I kept a shortcut to this program on my doc and used it constantly.  (We were running OS-X 10.6 Snow Leopard, but it supports more modern versions of OS-X as well.) We could charge it on any USB charger or juice pack, and the auto-off feature meant it could go more than a day at a time without needing a charge.  It is so light that we could just hang it from a USB charger on the wall by its USB cable while at home and use it while it was charging. Range was less than a dedicated wireless router, but we were still able to use it well a room away, through interior house walls (which in Germany were really solid).  Used this with a Macbook Pro and some iPads and iPods. I totally LOVE it - it's my new most favorite tech toy.  I would recommend this to anyone.

I got the second cable without a problem, then after running the entire length from basement to attic in our 1975 four bedroom condo and hooking to an HD cable receiver I called the cable company to activate the new box. I was a little worried about signal strength as I have two splitters in the line. First a 2-Way splitter, with one ""out"" going to a cable modem and the other into another 4-Way splitter. Among the 4 ""outs"" there was this 100' cable to the new HD cable box? Well, During the activation process with the Cable company we did have an issue at first but it turned out to be a bad HDMI cable. The tech with the cable company said it wasn't my cable connection because he could see that I had a ""very strong"" (his words) signal through the cable. Swapped out the HDMI cord and the HD signal was beautiful. In summary I learned if you stick with quality ""spitters"" and high-end cables like this one from Mediabridge with Compression connectors the length of the cable runs will be less of a factor.

This is probably my 4th router. I usually go with Netgear, and with good reason.  They usually work well and don't constantly need to be reset. However, I have had issues with one router in the past. Now that I have used this router for slightly over a year, I decided to write a review about it. First off, the ease of setup is remarkable. You take it out of the box. You put the cd disc in, it shows you the step by step process, and now you are done. Ready to go. I have mine hooked up to Clear, which is a 4G network. I have multiple laptop users in the house, as well as a Wii and a ps3.  The router works well for every system. I haven't had issues with losing connection with my video games, nor have I experienced inability to detect network from the laptops.  Lastly, some routers need to be constantly reset because the signal fades in and out. With this router, I haven't experienced that yet (knock on wood). Basically, I just wanted to write a quick review that allows others to know what success I have had with this router after a year and change. Out of the many options, it is one of the better ones.

I have gone from a basic WNR2000 from Netgear to a WNR3800 which I spent over $120 thinking it would be a solid performer and a lasting investment. After struggling with it for a few months, and going though 4 revisions of firmware for the darn thing. Hoping each one would make it the $120 router I thought I was buying. I eventually just tossed it. After that whole debacle I decided never again would I buy a expensive router. So here I am reviewing one of the more solid and easy routers I have ever worked with. The WNR1000 v3 is the one I bought, and to be frank I cannot imagine why if all you want is wireless access to the internet would you spend anymore then this on a router. The WNR1000 v3 was easy to setup, has almost equal range in 2.4Ghz compared to the WNR3800 and still has some useful features. You can argue that it has no gigabit LAN or WAN connections or a 5Ghz support duel band. You can also say that for $29 which is what I paid you should not expect it to last. But then I remember spending $120 on a router that lasted 6 months. So if this $29 lasts that long I will simply go out and buy another. Not feeling nearly as bad as throwing away a $120 one. What is the real scam is that most of my devices support only the 2.4Ghz band anyway and never connected at the claimed speeds of the more expensive WNR3800. So don't be fooled by marketing hype that your speeds will be so much better with a expensive router. Especially in the 2.4Ghz band. Its very crowded and if you have plenty of neighbors with wireless your going to get much less speed anyway. Something the router makers don't talk about. So in my opinion, don't over spend on a router thinking your getting range and speed. You may be just getting more features that cause more problems and you may not have a better quality connection.

I had another Netgear Router that had been recommended by a friend that worked flawlessly for 5 years, and then started to not work so great.  I figured it was just time to replace it - it gets used hard, and Netgear was no longer supporting the old router I had.,I was told this was a comparable model to the one I was replacing.  Set-up was easy and I was online quickly, but the good times were short lived.  From day one, about 8 hours out of the box, it began dropping our connection.  Sometimes once a day, sometimes every few hours.  Sometimes it would come back on after a brief pause, and other times it would require me to pull the power and wait for a reset that way.  It was frustrating, and I was told over and over by Netgear that it was my modem.  I had my cable company come out and check, and told me there was nothing wrong with the modem or my line.  Then I was told it was the cables I had.  I replaced all of them.  I finally gave up and resigned myself to the fact that this was normal.,Two weeks ago it suddenly got worse.  I contacted Netgear again, and I was told I was out of the warranty period (despite my complaining early on) and they wanted $75 for tech support.  I refused.  I got some e-mail support, but it was to update my firmware, however the directions they sent me did not match their own user interface that was on my computer.  They were asking me to click on buttons and tabs that simply weren't there.  While trying to update the firmware, Netgear downloaded ""Netgear Genie"" on my computer.  Things went from worse to incredibly bad right then and there.

Prior to ordering this cable however, you need to check a few things. First verify that your Mac actually outputs sound through the mini-display port. You can verify your specific model here- [...] Sorry, Amazon will not allow me to put in a direct link. Just go to the Apple support web site and enter ""About Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapters"" in search. You'll be taken to a page that lists all Macs and whether or not they output sound from their mini-display port. If you don't know what model and year your Mac is, follow these directions- Click Apple icon (upper left of your screen), click ""About This Mac"", click ""More Info"". On this screen you'll see the model and year (13 Inch, Mid 2009). If your Mac supports sound through the mini-display port, you're done. Go ahead and order the cable. If not, read further. If your model does not support sound output you can easily get around this by hooking up additional cabling (via the headphone jack or optical port dependent upon model). In either case you should also verify that your TV will accept both sound and audio through discrete sources. Even if your TV doesn't accept separate audio and video sources, if you planned to play sound through a separate receiver, you're okay. If you will not be using a separate audio source for sound and your TV does not support separate inputs for audio and sound (or maybe you're not sure) you may be better off purchasing an alternative device that combines sound and audio via cabling .

The new cable is a different type, so hopefully it's more robust. We will see if it lasts longer than the original cable, but I'm changing my rating from one star to three stars because of the effort. Better late than never. EDIT 05/26/15: The new cable has broken as well.

http://www.amazon.com/PS-Vita-Portable-Charger-Sony/dp/B006JKARP8,Great addition to my Vita kit...,http://www.amazon.com/PS-Vita-Portable-Charger-Sony/product-reviews/B006JKARP8," on May 6, 2012","To start off, this is a great portable battery.  It's simple one button operation makes it very easy to use.  I also really like how the power button lights up differently, with the same color code as the Vita itself, to let you know the status of the battery.  I received mine, plugged it in to charge, and in about 2 hours it was good to go.  The power button even blinks the different colors to let you know what the charging progress is.  It is very compact, recharges itself quickly, charges the Vita properly, and is at a very good price point...unlike the memory cards.  If Sony missed the mark with those, they definitely made up for it with this.,As far as the battery itself, there are cheaper alternatives, but they will not work properly with the Vita.  Here is why.  Practically every other battery of this size, capacity, and even in the ballpark of this price point, only has an output of 1.0 amps.  This battery has an output of 1.5 amps.  The PS Vita's internal circuitry looks for this output, and if it doesn't see it, it won't charge while powered up.  If you want to play while charging, or without shutting down completely, this is the only battery like this that will work.  You can't go by the ""5v, 5000mAh"" rating, as others have suggested.  If playing while charging is important to you, this is the battery you need.,Something to be mindful of, is that this battery is all you get in the package.  You will need the USB cable that came with the Vita, as well as the Vita power brick, to charge it.  You can also use the Sony Vita car charger to charge your battery on the go, or you can charge it via most any USB cell phone charger, or USB 2.0/3.0 port.  Remember, that like the Vita itself, this battery likes a 1.5 amp output for charging.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CJmuKxLGL._SY300_.jpg,PS Vita Portable Charger

I'm sitting in LaGuardia with a MiFi hotspot whose battery was low.  The Energizer portable laptop charger that I carry around to charge my phone, laptop, etc, wouldn't charge it while I was using the hotspot.  This Vita charger does, and is a fraction of the physical size.,-----------------ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW------------------------,The short of it:  AT LEAST 6 1/2 hours of non-wifi gameplay so far, and still going.,I intend to update this review once I get through a full cycle of the charger and perhaps also test it on some other devices, but for now I wanted to put something up so people on the fence can get some idea of the device.,I'm testing how much extra play this will give the Vita as we speak.  I ran down the existing battery charge until I got my first ""Low Battery"" message from the Vita.  After that, I plugged in the charger (after giving it time to fully juice up) and started playing a game through which I could track game time.,In my case, I chose the PSP game ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"".  Note that this games doesn't use any wifi and is probably pretty easy on the battery, but I wanted to guage the charge under some kind of consistent conditions.,OK, all that said, here is the point.  I've recorded six and a half hours of game time and the battery still has juice left.  And that is game time as measured by the game itself, e.g. I started using the charger as I was 22 hours 50 minutes into the game, and now the game clock says 29 hours 20 minutes.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CJmuKxLGL._SY300_.jpg,PS Vita Portable Charger

I have 3 power banks, 2 of them are at 5000mAh, 1 at 10200mAh. I am not satisfied with any of them for the following reasons: 1. One of them has a micro USB connector broken so I cannot use it to charge my android devices. I have only used it a few times. 2. The second one doesn't seem to have 5000mAh as claimed, it can only charge my Nexus 5 one time (it is only 6-month old). 3. The third one is the 10200mAh one, but it is really bulky and I haven't even used it once since I don't want to carry it... I have been doing a lot researches on all kinds of power banks/power packs and decided to give ZiLu power bank a try for the following reasons: 1. portable. I do like the slim design which can fit in my hand/pocket easily. 2. powerful. 13000mAh with 2.1A/1.0A output and two USB ports. 3. components. Samsung battery cells and TI IC chips, it is kind of rare to see these brand-name components in power banks. 4. Warranty. 1000 cycles and 2-yr warranty, and it is from Amazon, which I do trust. 5. Reviews. Well, there are only 4 of them, but all from reputable reviewers, so I think I may try to be one of the early reviewers. I will update with detailed reviews once I get it, keep an eye on the review! Ok, got it yesterday: 1. 75% charged already, so directly plugin two phones: Samsung Galaxy Light (27% battery left) and Nexus 5 (50% battery left). 4 hours later, both phones are 100% full. 2. The weight is ok and size is indeed smaller (more portable) than the other 3 power banks I have. Continue testing, so far so good with the following devices (charged to 100%): --ipad mini --ipad mini retina --ipad Air --dell venue pro 8 --samsung galaxy note II",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bwsyvk1LL._SY300_.jpg,"ZILU Smart Battery 13000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Pack Backup Power Bank for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S6 S5 S4 Note, Nexus, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, PS Vita, Gopro, more Phones and Tablets"

I bought the RAVPower Element 10400mAh one, it is not bad, but it has a few issues. Mainly the charge speed of battery pack itself. With < 0.7A current, it needs more than over night to charge the battery pack full. Also one fully charged battery pack is not enough to charge my IPAD 3, which has 11600mAh battery capacity.  Its square shape is also too bulky and gets too warm when I charge IPAD. So I gave it to my brother and look for a better one.,I found this at Amazon. It looks nice, the capacity is 13000mAH which is more than enough for one charge for IPAD3, and most importantly, charging current for battery pack itself is rated at 2A. so I ordered it. After using it more than a week, I could say I am not disappointed. I am very happy with it and highly recommend to anyone looking for a large capacity battery pack.,#################################################################,I used a USB current/voltage meter to measure the current and voltage. I tried a few different chargers. With a Samsung OEM 2A charger, the battery pack draws 2.02A and charges in less than 8 hours! It charges much faster than my old one. Then I tried the Nexus 7 OEM charger which is rated at 1.35A, The battery pack draws 1.5A and the charger just gets a little warm. The battery pack got charged overnight (I estimate charge time about 9-10 hours). Please note charge current gets down when battery pack is close to full.,I also tried IPAD charger, it draws about 1.2A, which is not as good as I expected, but still very respectful.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bwsyvk1LL._SY300_.jpg,"ZILU Smart Battery 13000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Pack Backup Power Bank for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S6 S5 S4 Note, Nexus, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, PS Vita, Gopro, more Phones and Tablets"

It worked great when I received it on July 1st. Exactly one month later, on August 1st, it completely stopped working. I thought it was just dead, but no lights flashed to indicate so. In fact, it gave no response at all.,I plugged it in and it charged just fine. The lights flashed as it charged, and all four were lit up bright when it was done. However, when I went to use it the very next day, it again gave me no response at all, despite being at a full charge.,The website printed on the power bank does not exist, giving one no way of actually contacting the company that made it. Amazon was nice enough to let me return it even though August 1st was actually the last day of the 30-day return policy, and I will be using the money to buy a different power bank.

This will follow your daily steps and sleep cycle movements. And signal for your device alarms such as calls, Text messaging, new E-Mail if the system is set to trigger an alert. The controll software can be downloaded from either fastfox.cn, Google play store (updated march 2015 v 1.1.4), and Apple. Once you have installed the apk to your device (I tested android galaxy SII i727). It is a fairly simple process and starts with the control apk. Run the apk select fastfox-light. it will establish a bluetooth connection to sync. If you device bungles the Bluetooth, you may need to start it again. I am using an SGH-i727 which is very old stuff (Galaxy Sii) but I have worked with a BT keyboard while streaming muzak. So there should be little interuptions with the fast fox operating. The device works with an Arm 4 GPU running from a 1632 battery.  One is pre-installed for ready use, and an extra is shipped in the packaging. The FastFox is IP67 good for 1.5 meters. so it should have no problem with rain or showerstalls.

It is so thin, so simple, so elegant. The app works, and it's not cluttered with information I don't want. It's waterproof. I can wear it in the shower and not worry about ruining it. It's comfortable. There are no metal prongs to irritate my skin. The app tells me how much I've slept (deep sleep and light sleep), which seems to be quite accurate when I consider what time I've gone to bed and how I'm feeling the next day. I don't have to tell it I'm sleeping. It just knows. The activity monitor counts our ""steps,"" which should be labeled ""arm movements."" It calculates how much we've run and how many Calories we've burned. Honestly, it can't be a fully accurate pedometer, but it's good as a way to gauge activity. On days I'm more active, I've walked more ""steps."" When I'm at my desk all day, I can see it in the chart. Yes, that app charts all: daily, weekly, monthly. The face of the activity tracker doesn't show time, date, or anything else. It flashes when calls come in, but it is such a tiny dot as to be barely noticeable, even when I'm looking for it. I tried to film it, but the reflection of the red light from my camcorder obscured the blue light. Seriously, though. Who needs a flashing light? If the phone is close enough for the Bluetooth to be connected, chances are, we'd hear the phone. For those who want it, this feature only works on Android phones. I'm very happy with this activity monitor. I plan to wear it until it breaks. Just something to keep me motivated. This product was provided for review by Hofan. ________________ UPDATE 6/20/15:  Sadness.  My fastfox stopped working.  It still pairs.  I see the blue flashing light.

It's a midrange external battery in terms of capacity (with respectable 13,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.,In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, Kindle Paperwhite, Mobee Magic Bar, Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset , and iPad Mini. Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged RAVPower battery. I was also able to charge my iPad Mini completely twice.

I've gone through a half-dozen mounts from both no-name to brand-name and ended up returning them all. My BMW probably doesn't help. It's got a dashboard with a pebbled/textured finish. It's not perfectly flat. And I drive like a jerk. The latter is a crucial point of failure for mounts with a longer reach that multiply the leverage of a heavy phone on a suction cup. Read: mount (with phone attached) goes flying off to the side, usually into my passenger's face. I figured this one had physics working in its favor off the bat, being so short (but I was a tad worried about it having the phone out of reach). Turns out that's not a problem. Neither is the AMAZING grip on the dashboard side. As others mentioned, it's a suction cup AND an (reusable) adhesive pad. This means it ain't going nowhere. I've verified this with plenty of...brisk driving in both hot and cold climes. Also nice is the simple, fail-proof, spring-loaded holster. It's a very robust spring so there's no chance of the phone falling out accidentally, and it doesn't try anything funny in terms of foam pads or awkward positioning. It's deep/wide enough to accommodate even a slightly bulky hard case as well. True, it DOES take some practice/effort to insert and remove the phone one-handed. But it's not impossible, unless you're an invalid or really, really uncoordinated in which case, you should ask yourself: should you even be driving? That said, this is a very well-buit, well-engineered, simple mount that will hold your phone and not launch itself into someone's eye socket when taking a freeway offramp at three times the recommended speed.

I attached it on Nissan Altima's textured dashboard, and it hangs on perfectly. Two things I noted were.. if you want to remove it from your dashboard, it's not quite easy since the suction cup is a bit sticky. And when you drive with your phone on this item, it wobbles a little tiny bit, but not much and it does not bother me at all. I'm thinking about buying another one for my wife.

After looking around and at the reviews I decided to try this out.  I drive a stick 2002 Honda Civic and have a dash cover so instead of putting the mount on dash as most people do, I wanted to mount it closer to the shifter mainly so I can switch music. There isn't a lot of space to mount it, and the only suitable place I could find was UNDER the radio where the mount would be upside down.  I had got the mount in the afternoon and didn't even use alcohol wipes to clean the surface.  I just stuck it on, clamped it down, and it hasn't come off since I bought it (~2 months ago). I place and remove my phone twice or more daily, all with no problems.  It isn't really that hard to use one hand to put it in, but it is a lot easier with two.  The clamp is very secure and my Galaxy S2 with thick Seidio case fits just fine.  My girlfriend's S3 fits as well.  The weight isn't a problem for the mount, and the swivel works fine if the passenger wants to watch a Youtube clip or something.

I looked at many other bikes before I decided on this one. The main selling feature was that it came with a hand break standard. My older daughter was almost in a horrible crash when she was 5 because the chain came off her bike on a hill, so the brakes didn't work. Yes, I know that she could have put her feet down to stop, but she was too scared to think of it at the time. Thank God a stranger heard our yelling and stepped in to stop her. The bike came well packed in a box with all the tools needed to assemble. The directions were in broken English but the pictures were easy to follow. It took me 20 to 30 min to put together mostly because I had ""help"". My daughter loves the girlie color and the ribbons on the handle bars. I like the fact that there are no pictures of princesses, Barbie, or any other character that could fall out of favor and therefore start the whine for a new bike with the latest favorite character on it. Here are the downsides: 1. the training wheels have very little adjust to them, so you can't raise them off the ground as your child gains skill. 2. the plastic fasteners on the basket are not very strong so plan on using something else to keep the basket on long term, like zip ties 3. The bike ships from the factory in China so shipping takes a little longer. UPDATE: My now 4 yr old daughter has been riding this bike almost every day for over 3 months now and we are still happy with it. We have found it to be very sturdy and have only had to reattach the bell once and have tightened all the bolts. I was a little worried that the training wheels were not wide enough to keep the bike stable, but they seem to be fine. She really has to work at it to tip this bike over. I am happy with this purchase and would buy this bike again.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HK7PlBCML._SY300_.jpg,"Royalbaby Stargirl Girls Bike with Training Wheels and Basket, Best Gifts for Girls.

We ordered this bike this past Saturday evening.  We decided to get our younger daughter her own brand-new bicycle, and went with a 12"" model.  She's petite, and will be on a 12"" for at least another year, unless she has a massive growth spurt. :D So instead of heading to the usual big box suspects, I decided to see what's here on Amazon, as I've been doing a lot more shopping on Amazon lately.  Anyway, the Royalbaby line came up on the search, and since my daughter's favorite color is blue, this bike seemed like it would be a perfect match.  Placed the order Saturday evening [8/30] and arrived yesterday [9/3].  Was shipped out of their eastern distribution center in New Jersey.,Opened it up and assembled it last night.  First off, the bike was amazingly well packed.  The entire bike was wrapped in bubble wrap, and there were big plastic discs attached to the rear hubs to stabilize the bike in the box.  These discs fit nice and snug up against the box's inner walls.  The handle bars were zip-tied to the frame, and again, wrapped in bubble wrap.  The smaller parts were in their own box.,Once I got everything unwrapped, I was able to inspect the bike.  The quality is top notch.  The paint was absolutely perfect.  Beautiful paint job.  The welds were great, and even the training wheel struts are nice solid heavy steel with a tough, durable paint job.  Looks like they're powdercoated.  And compontents are all high quality.  Assembly was quick and easy---they even include a nifty multi-wrench and Allen wrench with the long end shaped into a Phillips head screw driver.  All you'll need is a pair of nips to cut the zip-ties.,As was posted in other reviews, you should just replace the basket ties with a couple of good zip-ties.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HK7PlBCML._SY300_.jpg,"Royalbaby Stargirl Girls Bike with Training Wheels and Basket, Best Gifts for Girls.

Well-made and well-put-together, and everything functions as it should.  But I did lose an hour putting it together.  Then I lost another 45 minutes adjusting the height of the seat, handlebar, and training wheels; adjusting the gap and alignment of the front brakes.  Then I lost another 45 minutes readjusting some of those things and tightening accessories after my daughter's first ride on the bike.  Even after those adjustments, one side of the front brakes doesn't quite release as far as I would like.

Our son is 4 years old, but in the lower 30% for height (just like mom) so he's probably closer in size to the typical 3 1/2 year old.  It came out of the box well-packed and protected.  Color and stickers are more appealing in person than in photos; frankly, I considered it ugly based on pics but in person, I really like the look. Assembly took 10 minutes with tools handy, primarily 12, 13, 14 and 15mm wrenches.  Probably could have done it in 5min, but I also checked the tightness on the pre-assembled parts and lubed the chain.  Due to my sons height, I also had to tweak the seat and handlebars to accommodate his shorter arms and legs.  Having owned a bicycle before, I did not need the instructions: you are basically just putting on the front wheel, installing the handlebars, training wheels and seat.  But if you really are unaccustomed to mechanical stuff, the directions looked only mildly incomprehensible. Addressing other issues mentioned in reviews: Mine came out of the box in perfect condition.  Everything was protected with cardboard.  The frame IS less robust than many other comparable 16"" boys bikes right now, but does not seem more fragile than the bike I remember owning 30 years ago, and I beat the heck out of mine.  Most of the  other bikes I looked at out there seemed to have incredibly overbuilt frames, and thus heavier than is comfortable for a 3-5yo to learn on. Dislikes: No kickstand, though not yet needed with training wheels.  No reflectors, though the bike itself is very visible (yellow with silver stickers).  Pedals seemed a little small?  With rounded outside ends.  I'd prefer a square pedal, my sons feet slipped off them a few times when he started out. In short: it aint a cadillac, but its pretty decently built and a good non-licensed-theme basic starter bike for 3-5 year olds.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BQB4Mx-KL._SX300_.jpg,"Dynacraft Magna Major Damage Boy's Bike (16-Inch, Yellow/Black)"

One for myself and two for employees.  I immediately open the box and charge all three on 3 different outlets.  I charged them all for 14 hours the first time.  Two of them only charged to 80%(3 LEDS lit) and the third charger only charges to 50%(2 LEDS lit) capacity.  I was upset already so decided to email poweradd.  They emailed back after a few days that I needed to charge for more than 10 hours.  I immediately emailed them back stating I charged all three for 14 hours.  Didn't hear back from them so decided to contact Amazon about my defective purchase.  Amazon was all over it and asked if poweradd had contacted me with any suggestions.  I told them they had  and I even called the number on their paperwork a bunch of times.  That number goes nowhere and they don't ever return any phone calls if you leave a message.  After amazon contacted me all of a sudden Poweradd was sending emails trying to help me. (They ignored me before I got amazon involved).  Poweradd said in order to get the battery to maximum potential I would have to completely charge and discharge all of my units 3 times which takes a long time and a lot of damn effort.  I went ahead and did that for all three units and it took me over a week.  Now I am sure that all 3 are defective because none of them can get to 100% power.  One of them won't even charge past 50%(2 LEDS).  These are brand new units.  I would suggest if anyone buys this bad product you test it first and see if you are getting all 4 LEDS.  How is it even possible they can ship out 3 brand new units that are ALL DEFECTIVE.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NAqrHJ%2BL._SY300_.jpg,"Poweradd™ Pilot 2GS 10000mAh Portable Charger with Auto Detect Technology External Battery Power Bank Fast Charging for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air 2 Mini 3, Samsung Galaxy S6 S5 S4 Note 4 3, HTC One M9, Motorola, Nokia, Gopro, More Phones and Tablets(Apple Adapters Not Included) - Silver"

We brought 3 of these devices with us on a 3 night camping trip to a music festival a couple weekends ago.  We had our phones charging during the drive (off the car, not the devices) and we're all at 100% when we got there.  By the end of Night 2 we only had two chargers with power and both of those had 1 light left on the battery meter.  We had 4 phones charged two times and the 5th once by that time for a total of 9 charges and all 3 devices were nearly dead (one was fully dead).  The following day we got two phones to about 60% battery from 5% before the devices died completely.  Considering that 3 got about 10 charges total before dying I don't see how one gets five.  The next festival I'm going to is 4 nights/5 days so I will be bringing two of these for myself and recommending my friends do the same.  The size on this was small enough I could keep it in my shorts pocket while charging and then just toss it in the small pocket on my Camelbak when done charging. Please note these devices do not turn off automatically once you hit 100% so you will drain the battery on this if you leave your phone unattended charging overnight or charging too long.  We thankfully caught this before leaving on the trip or it would've been trouble. For the price I would DEFINITELY recommend but do not believe five charges of an iPhone - more likely is 3-4 charges and 4 is pushing it (may only get 50-60% charge the 4th time).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NAqrHJ%2BL._SY300_.jpg,"Poweradd™ Pilot 2GS 10000mAh Portable Charger with Auto Detect Technology External Battery Power Bank Fast Charging for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air 2 Mini 3, Samsung Galaxy S6 S5 S4 Note 4 3, HTC One M9, Motorola, Nokia, Gopro, More Phones and Tablets(Apple Adapters Not Included) - Silver"
http://www.amazon.com/The-Crossover-Kwame-Alexander/dp/0544107713,A terrific verse novel with a wide range of appeal,http://www.amazon.com/The-Crossover-Kwame-Alexander/product-reviews/0544107713," on April 28, 2014","Kwame Alexander's newest novel, THE CROSSOVER, is a verse tour de force. It's told through poems by the main character, Josh Bell a.k.a. Filthy McNasty. He and his twin brother Jordan (JB) are talented basketball players, but jealousy threatens to split them apart when JB gets a girlfriend.,I love how many levels of story are woven into this novel.,THE CROSSOVER is the kind of book I never would've picked up when I was younger because I didn't like sports. There is the sports story promised by the cover, all leading up to a big championship game, but it is far from the only plotline. Nor is it the most important plotline. That's reserved for all the family stuff.,There's the relationship between the brothers, at times super close and at other times strained. In fact, the first real schism in the story is when JB accidentally forces Josh to get his head shaved. Before, Josh's locks were his pride and separated him from his bald brother. Then, there is the relationship with the boys' parents, especially their father, a former basketball player and the man who taught them the game. Their parents' worries are on the fringe of Josh's awareness, but most readers will be able to put the pieces together. And, although she is a small part, the girl ""Sweet Tea"" is still shown to be a person, a talented basketball player in her own right and pissed off by the physical signs of Josh's jealousy, frustration, and confusion.,All of this is conveyed so elegantly by the language.,Alexander's poetry flows easily and tells the story in short pieces, making THE CROSSOVER inviting to reluctant and casual readers. At the same time, it's a sophisticated and rewarding form.",,The Crossover

Which is really rather odd since I do enjoy watching them.  But after reading this I can easily see why it has received so much acclaim.  It's a beautifully written, powerful story about family and change.  I sat down to read this and I was immediately impressed with the verse.  The language drew me in and made me care about Josh and his family.  The exciting poems that were about actually playing basketball were so well done that I could see Josh on the floor making for the basket. It always amazes me when an author creates a powerful story in verse, in so few words.  The characters here are vivid and clear, each one shines through as an individual, which is all the more interesting since the story is told from Josh's point of view.  The plot revolves around Josh's love of basketball, his father's refusal to see a doctor, and his brother's gaining a girlfriend.  Except for basketball, Josh's world is shaken to the core by his father's ongoing refusal to address physical problems, and his brother's focus on his new girlfriend.  His frustration leads him to do something he greatly regrets.  The climax was a shock although I should have seen it coming, there were certainly enough clues.  But when you don't want something to happen, it's easy not to be prepared when it happens, even when it's in a story. I'd say this is definitely one of the best books I've read in the last year and I highly recommend it.",,The Crossover

I need a big meaty story if I'm going to enjoy a book, especially a book about sports.  I loved The Crossover.  I'm a sports fanatic, and this book is filled with tons of well written basketball action that speaks to everything that true basketball fans love about the game.  Josh has such a strong narrative voice that I could easily envision him out on the court flying high enough to throw down a crowd pleasing dunk. The language is dazzling, from Josh's game time raps, and confrontations with his brother, to his powerful conversations with his dad that convey an astounding amount of emotions in just a few spare lines.  The author utilizes unique constructions, fonts, and styles that make the text even more dynamic.  This is not a standard novel, yet it will serve as a welcome introduction to reading novels in verse for many young readers. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this book is its unflinching look at family.  This is a real family facing real problems that will serve to impact all their lives.  None of them are perfect, but they stand by each other and love each other unflinchingly, even when they are confronted with the worst possible outcomes.  Throw into all this two boys coming of age, growing apart, and discovering their own paths through love and grief.  This is a powerful book and an enthusiastic recommend for young readers ages 10 and up.",,The Crossover

Everything is in order; everything is under control.  The people have no worries or cares.  The Community strives for ""sameness,"" in which everyone and everything are the same and equal.  To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society.  When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new ""Receiver of Memories."" Only the ""Giver"" knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas.,The Giver is a wonderful book.  Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story.  She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this ""perfect world.""  The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia.  To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people.  In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse.  Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life.  For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings.  The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love.  One of the goals of the Community is to achieve ""sameness"" so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different.  However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image.",,The Giver (Giver Quartet)

Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Eights, and the Committee of Elders assigns them their roles in the Community at the Ceremony of Twelves. Because the people have chosen Sameness, nothing in their  Community is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices.,The Receiver of Memory holds the position of highest honor within the Community, serving as the repository for the memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever the Committee of Elders are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek the counsel and  advice of the Receiver. They have the benefit of experience without having to bear its pain.,Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Capacity to See Beyond, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The current Receiver, who has held the position for decades, then becomes the Giver.,Ms. Lowry paints a vivid picture of this Community. Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called ""newchildren,"" for example; children of the same age are ""groupmates""; the elderly, the unhealthy, or those who have broken the rules three times may be ""released."",Why might parents or teachers consider THE GIVER inappropriate for their children?",,The Giver (Giver Quartet)

Jonas is the main character in the book The Giver, my favorite book. I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative, the theme was  magnificent, and the setting was vivid. I think you should read this book  for many reasons. The theme of this book is clearly represented: freedom,  the right to make your own choices, uniqueness, and individuality are worth  dying for. In Jonas's community, a commitee selects one's job, war is  unheard of, all people wear the same attire, and all are assigned spouses  and families. When Jonas is given the special, wonder-filled occupation of  becoming the Receiver of Memory, he finds that there is much more to life.  Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he discovers the  meaning of love, pain, frustration, color, and cold. That is when Jonas  realizes how much more there really is. Life soon becomes overwhelmingly  unbearable in his world of ""sameness."" He finds life isn't worth  living without the qualities (often that we take for granted) he  discovered. That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land  that is different. The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure.  Everything in the community was predictable and pre-planned. The housing  units were all the same. There were designated spots for everything. The  setting helped develop the plot and theme. The mysterious ending leaves one  filled with curiousity and wonder. The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is  guaranteed enjoyment, especially for someone who likes a good theme and  plot that ties in with the setting.

It comes with a clip which can be used to attach it to a back pack. The main functionality is that it connects to your mobile device and allows you to receive calls without touching your phone with your hands ( might be dirty or dusty depending on your outdoor activity) It performs that function pretty adequately since the buttons are covered with a sort of slicone or plastic which is easy to clean and it connects okay to the mobile phone.,It can also be used as a remote speaker which you connect with your laptop . In that aspect I can rate this function as average. Firstly because of its shorter range compared to many wireless speakers. Normally bluetooth headsets operate within 30feet while bluetooth speakers can go up to 3 times this distance ( like 90 feets) This one, despite being a speaker, is only as strong as a headset and immediately loses connection outside 30Feet range ( even shorter range when there is a wall or something like that in between.) Besides it does not have an aux input so that it has to be used with bluetooth connection, which is another inconvenience too.,Sound quality is good but not great...

David Simpson went so far beyond the android phase in his Post-Human series that it clearly deserves a place among the the classics of sci-fi. Sounding like Neal Stephenson of AI, Simpson fully explores mankind's future with computers, nanotechnology, cybernetics and artificial intelligence. He even extrapolated meeting aliens with data agendas. It is abundantly obvious that Mr. Simpson put a huge amount of time, research and effort into playing out the different scenarios that would occur before he wrote these books. It is wonderful to see that type of effort put forth and pay off so beautifully. It made the books enter territory never ventured into before by other authors and so was incredibly exciting to read. His imagination is virtually breathtaking. The characters in the book that all participated with the technology were naturally flawed and human -even the the AI appeared to be a human. They all had a preponderance of good qualities that stood out. My favorite characters were Craig, James and the AI. This is really like the old time Isaac Asimov novels, and is just as groundbreaking. I have been reading sci-fi all my life, and while some authors may provide something new every now and then, what Simpson has done is lay out a century of technical advances that completely transform the human race.

I would like to start by saying that I did enjoy many things about this book, but it surely has some big flaws. First thing you should know is that you will have to have read the other two books of the trilogy, as this book will not stand alone.  I was captured by the interesting plot and historical references in the first book, but must say the series has definitely progressed in quite a different direction. This book, while striving to provide detailed backstory and wrap up our characters' journey, has become a bit unfocused. We have basically lost all connection to the planet earth, the interesting global pandemic, politics, and most of the emotional connection to our characters. The book delves into the past to show us the alien motivations and actions that lead to the Atlantis plague.  We are taken to different planets and walked through epic space battles and new alien civilizations. Most of the characters felt like they were just devices to move the plot along, or carried over from the last book without reason there was little to no development.  I could have done without all but Kate and David and the Atlanteans. I am a fan of sci-fi and I really enjoyed a lot of the ideas here, but they were nothing new or original.  I think Mr. Riddle's ideas were a bit too grandiose to try and squeeze into the trilogy. Most of this book feels like a prequel. I read this book in a day and a half, so clearly it kept my interest. I wanted to see where it was going, but ultimately I was let down by the quick resolutions and lack of emotional connection.",,"The Atlantis World (The Origin Mystery, Book 3)"

If you haven't read it...try it and see,http://www.amazon.com/Atlantis-World-Origin-Mystery-Book-ebook/product-reviews/B00JVUQ2H0," on May 15, 2014","  I stumbled upon the first book (The Atlantis Gene) after reading another novel on my Kindle.  I think the first thing that drew me to trying it out, was the fact that some of my current favorite authors didn't have anything on the market for the near future, and secondly for the price.  After reading The Atlantis Gene in one day, I became hooked and wanted more of the story.  The second novel (The Atlantis Plague) picked up where the first left off, but created new questions for me and made me thirst for the third and final novel (hopefully to answer all the questions it posed for me).  Well... the final novel (The Atlantis World) did exactly as promised and again I raced through it in just one day.  All I can say is I love Mr. Riddle's style and hope he is able to firstly take a little break to regroup and secondly keep writing more.  I will follow his publications and keep checking for more.  I consider his work to be equal in my minds eye, to established authors such as David Baldacci, James Rollins, and Steve Berry. I highly recommend picking this novel up, but if you haven't read The Atlantis Gene, start there first.  You will definitely enjoy this book and trilogy as I have.",,"The Atlantis World (The Origin Mystery, Book 3)"

However, there are two big problems here: 1) This book was rushed and it shows in the poor writing. 2) The ending is very disappointing. On the first point, it appears that A.G. Riddle's writing got worse. The characters were not developed effectively. The dialogue was dry and repetitive. The author has a great imagination and I just wish that he had spent more time revising the third book before sending it to print. On the second point, the build up of tension between the heroes and villains should have been resolved in a meaningful way. Also, there is no need to resolve minor side plots in the series (the baby, Major and Natalie, etc.). The author should have spent more time developing the major plot lines. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: The author cheats us out of resolving conflict between David and Dorian, Ares and the Serpents, Lykos and Dorian, etc. etc. If you are going to build up tension between characters, you'd better resolve that tension or you are going to have some very bitter fans. Still fans, but bitter fans. The deaths of both Ares and Dorian felt like a major cop out. I could go on because this is a sore spot for me but I don't want to totally ruin the book for anyone.

G. Riddle set up.  Once I learned the characters and what their role was I found the entire story fascinating.  I was very excited to find out THe Atlantis World was available.  While I still enjoyed the story spun, book 3 was by far the hardest to follow.  While immersed in the story I kept finding myself needing to go back to hopefully get clarification and thinking to myself--I just may need to read this a couple of times to make sense of all the different parts.  I felt as though with the different pieces with the Sentinels, the Serpentine Army, the Exiles and the beloved Atlateans, there were too many different groups involved in this and after so much development it felt as though there was a rush to the end.  Now, I am certainly not an author, and perhaps I'm just sad that this series has come to end, but I felt the last third of the book was confusing and ended somewhat abruptly.  Yes, there is an ending to the story but it feels somewhat incomplete.  I would still recommend reading it because if you enjoyed the beginning 2 books to this story you'll need to see where it all ends up. I hope this helps.",,"The Atlantis World (The Origin Mystery, Book 3)"

I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader. Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with. But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal. Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512PxduineL._SY300_.jpg,MetalTac Airsoft Speed Loader with Capacity of 100 Bbs

If you don't know how it works, it is like a spring loaded syringe for loading BBs into an airsoft gun magazine.  You fill the reservoir with BBs, line up the hole on the bottom of the loader with the hole in your magazine and push the plunger down.  Usually 4 or 5 BBs are loaded for every push.  I fill 25-round pistol magazines in about 2 seconds, instead of pushing 25 BBs in one-by-one.,When you are done loading, turn the loader upside-down so the  BBs fall to the top of the loader, push the plunger in and push the lock button to lock the plunger inside the loader so it doesn't get broken off during play.,You can find speed loaders that hold more BBs but these 90 - 120 round loaders are the perfect size for carrying in pistol magazine pouches.,I ordered 15 of these for myself and some friends.  Including the shipping cost, they ended up costing $1.90 each.

This was the only cover that met all my requirements.  First, waterproof.  My sister visits regularly with her two little dogs, and though the small amount of liquid they produce has never made it all the way through to my mattress,  I now enjoy the sight of the two darling dogs curled up on my guest bed a lot more.  Second, I live in one of the allergy capitals of the world, and I wanted a good allergy cover.  It works well for this.  Third, washable.  It's been washed in hot water and dried on medium a number of times and has remained waterproof.  It will come out of the washer with pockets of water trapped in it, so you have to uncurl it and let the water drain out before putting it in the dryer.  Several reviewers mentioned that their different brand of cover split after washing and drying.  This one has not ripped.  Fourth, doesn't make the sleeper sweaty.  Since I haven't been through a summer with it yet, I don't know for sure, but some of the reviewers mentioned that it doesn't make them feel hot. So far I've found this to be true.  I do use a cotton mattress pad between it and the bottom sheet.  Fifth, it doesn't smell like plastic.  Its fabric is soft and flexible, and doesn't make noise.  I'm very pleased with this mattress cover.  I'm glad I found it. Update:  I've been using the two covers I bought for almost two years now.  They get washed in hot water and dried in the dryer.  They have not split or gotten stiff and crunchy.  They still feel nice to the touch and the fabric is strong and intact.

Lasted about two years and then the plastic backing split and gave way, even though I never put these things in the dryer. So, I figured I'd aim for something higher quality this time, even if it did cost a bit more. So far this is what I was looking for: It doesn't smell of plastic (didn't even when I first took it out of the package), the backing seems to be attached better to the cover, and the corners haven't popped off the mattress in the middle of the night like my previous one would. It's contained a few small spills already, so I would vouch for its effectiveness within reason. The caveats? I didn't realize that there really is no foam padding in it. It's about the thickness (and terry-cloth texture) of a beach towel. That's not a deal-breaker for me, but if you want padding--be advised. I don't dry it in the dryer (just let it hang dry), so I can't comment on how well it would hold up under that treatment. All in all, it meets my expectations and I'm pretty happy with it. If it lasts longer than two years, then it'll be a five star product as far as I'm concerned.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PRnheTMAL._SX300_.jpg,Full Size SafeRest Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector - Vinyl Free

The first surprise awaiting him there is that the skilful manager of his new estate is a woman, Alys Weston, strangely beautiful and very competent.,Alys is afraid to lose her position as Strickland's manager when the new master settles on the estate, seemingly for good. But Reggie, although intrigued by this woman who dresses in pantaloons and supervises the estate in a masterful way, doesn't dismiss her, and he quickly treats her as his equal. It's not just her managerial skills that fascinate Reggie, but also her uncommon beauty. She's taller than the average woman and her eyes don't match, but what she sees as flaws makes her even more beautiful in the eyes of her new master.,The unusual relationship that develops between them keeps the reader enthralled from start to finish. If Reggie's reputation as a rake followed him to Strickland, Alys doesn't let it destabilise her. She fears for her wards at first, especially the lovely and innocent Meredith, but Reggie is quick to reassure her that he has no interest in the young woman. Indeed, his fantasies are set on Alys herself.,One aspect of the book that was particularly interesting is Reggie's fight against his addiction to alcohol. There are several powerful scenes that show how far alcohol can lead, and without any voyeurism or overboard drama, Mary Jo Putney draws her hero's journey through this delicate part of his life, as well as Alys' influence on his behaviour.,Alys' character is as complicated as her male counterpart's.",,The Rake
http://www.amazon.com/The-Rake-Mary-Jo-Putney/dp/0451406869,"Truly stunning, heartwrenching and haunting",http://www.amazon.com/The-Rake-Mary-Jo-Putney/product-reviews/0451406869," on October 5, 2000","  The other review I wrote of this book got mangled almost beyond recognition, so I'm going to post a better one. I only discovered Mary Jo Putney earlier this year, and bought a few of her earlier books to get me started. Since I noticed that The Rake is a sequel to The Diabolical Baron, I read the latter first; found it enjoyable but nothing wildly out of the ordinary. I was thus not expecting too much when I realised that the villain of 'Baron' was the hero of The Rake. But I realised very quickly that I underestimated Putney. She doesn't try to force anyone to like Reggie; it's clear from the outset that he is a drunk and a gambler, and that he doesn't see anything wrong in sponging off his cousin, the Earl. But we also learn fairly early on that his behaviour has been shaped by circumstances. Put into the *right* circumstances, he begins to mend his ways. Alys is a wonderful heroine, and her first meeting with Reggie is a terrific read. She knows he wants her - and, of course, her very unorthodox position as his farm manager, dressing in trousers most of the time, won't give him any illusions about her virtue. But she insists that she's not that kind of woman... and gradually, they become friends. Reggie is an alcoholic, as becomes clear, and Putney pulls no punches as to its effect on his behaviour. Like some of her other books, this one contains harrowing scenes. And yet these are enlivened by flashes of humour; Reggie, when he's sober, is a delightful and witty person. I just loved this book from start to finish. And now that I've written about it, I want to go and read it again!",,The Rake

Reggie makes a great rake, but even better is his struggle to reform. The way the author writes this book adds realism and  credibility. While most romance books prefer to not broach serious topics  like alchoholism (usually they get a bit dark and depressing), Ms. Putney  does an excellent job at entwining it with the romance. I liked this book  very much. The heroine isn't bad, but the hero is delightfully complex,  and just this side of delectable. The whole book was utterly realistic  until the end, which I thought was a bit stretching reality, but that's  really the most I can find to complain about. This book was absoloutly  wonderful. I'd recommend this to someone that wants a romance with  realistic characters and a good plot. This author's writing is very good.",,The Rake

But this book is not at all ""preachy."" She definitely shows, not tells, what it is like to overcome addiction. Her hero, while a ""rake"" and bad boy, has an extremely noble and generous heart. The heroine is wonderful, too. Another of Ms. Putney's strong, independent, and wonderfully compassionate and giving heroines. I also particularly loved in this book the fascinating interweaving of historical details about farming on estates in the Regency.",,The Rake

It's an extremely well written, intense book about a complicated hero and a strong heroine. Reggie Davenport is the Rake of the title with a dreadful reputation.  He's a damaged individual who has so far spent his life womanising, gambling and above all, drinking to excess yet he is inevitably charming, has a wicked sense of humour and you find that he has his own code of honour.  He is given a chance to turn his life around when his cousin gives him a prosperous estate in Dorsetshire and there he encounters the steward responsible for running his property so successfully. The steward in question, AE Weston, turns out to be Alys Weston who has her own demons to escape from.  The story of their developing relationship is really well drawn, the author lets you see into the heads of both of the main protagonists.  The plot lines are believable and there are two charming secondary romances.  A big part of the story concerns Reggie's gradual realisation of his dependence on alcohol and his fight to become sober but this is all really sympathetically done and well woven into the story line.  Alys's support is vital and gives their relationship a great added dimension. I absolutely loved both the main characters, found the whole story charming, funny on occasion and also very moving in parts.  It's a shame this book is out of print - it deserves to be reissued.",,The Rake

It felt to me like an ambush site.  Indeed, this is exactly what is was, as vividly depicted in Craig Roberts' excellent book. If you want to understand what really happened on this blackest day of American history, you simply must read this book.  The chances are it will go quickly for you.  I ordered the book through Amazon and found it on my door step on a Saturday evening.  The following morning at 1:30am, I turned the final page of the narrative with the assurance that I finally understood what really happened on November 22, 1963 and, most importantly, why. In particular, I was intrigued that the author was led to investigate the facts through his warrior instincts and that his investigation led far beyond the scope of what he originally thought to be an unsolved murder.  The trail of this investigation leads beyond the Mafia, the CIA, the FBI, the US military, and all of the usual suspects right up to the small group of extraordinarily powerful men who truly control this world.

While I got some of that I got much more.,It begins with some sniper insight (the author was a military sniper) and proceeds on to the normal discrepancies with the Kennedy autopsy and the many unanswered questions we have heard in many books before.  But amidst all this is some interesting insight that is offered by the author, gained through his military experience and his former job of working on airplanes, the same kind that Air Force One (at the time) was converted from - the Boeing 707. With this information and with information obtained from Carlos Hatchock (who wrote his own excellent book titled ""Marine Sniper, 93 Confirmed Kills) he explains the impossibility of the lone gunman theory.,He explains in detail the many enemies that Kennedy made during his administration, The Mafia, The Military, The Cubans, The CIA, The Council on Foreign Relations, The FBI, Lyndon Johnson, the list sometimes seems endless.,The book does take off into unexpected territory by progressing to areas such as MACV in Vietnam, Harry Truman, the assination of Abraham Lincoln, James Monroe, John D. Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Howard Hughes, Watergate and much more.  But it is all tied together in the end with the final assumption of who killed JFK - and it is very believable.  Every conspiracy book on the subject presents itself in ways to be believed by the readers.  But this book touches on one point and presents it in clear and concise way that none of the other books I have read can.  It answers the question, ""Who could pull off a conspiracy of this magnitude and have enough power and influence to cover it up for 40 years, even though every free thinking individual would know it was a consipiracy?",,Kill Zone: A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza

Craig Roberts has painstakingly spent hour upon hour researching his material and has government documentation (included in the book) to boot.,So much of what you read here was never researched by the Warren Commission, never revealed by the mass media, and covered up by the FBI and other governmental agencies to mislead the American public.,The original JFK investigation (Warren Commission, etc.) was, without a doubt, one of the most heinous, deplorable, and saddest travesties of justice ever forced on the American public. This book will show you why and open your eyes.,Not only does Craig Roberts investigate the assassination, later in the book you will find very revealing information and names involved in power structures that have played a part in very significant happenings in the history of this country.  It's not a pretty picture and if you are a patriotic, down to earth American citizen, you will probably find yourself angry and disgusted with what has happened to America and her citizens. And you'll have every right to feel that way.,If you find this book revealing, you should also read Craig Roberts book JFK: The Dead Witnesses.  This explores in detail all of the mysterious and unusual deaths that have surrounded those who were connected to the JFK assassination either directly or indirectly.,Last but not least, if you want an explosive account of government cover-ups and conspiracies all the way from World War II germ warfare up to the downing of TWA Flight 800 and everything in-between, Craig Roberts book THE MEDUSA FILE will make your hair stand on end.",,Kill Zone: A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza

Over the past year I've tried to subdue that anticipation as much as possible - sure that it could only lead to disappointment.,I couldn't have been more wrong.,This is the story I've been waiting for. The sexual tension between Hawke and Sienna is nearly explosive. Hawke doesn't take too long to come around to the decision that his wolf has been pushing him towards - pursue Sienna. It might take a little creativity on Sienna's part, but once he does; Oh boy. There are a few `almost' moments, where Hawke and Sienna's courting is interrupted by everything from injuries to Psy scouting parties to outright attacks, and you could feel the frustration, as well as the responsibility in each of those moments.,Hawke was the same alpha that I've always loved. The alpha who has feral wolves claiming him as their own alpha. In this dangerous war with the Psy, Hawke barely has time to set aside his responsibilities. So he never does. He and Sienna steal small moments, with the help of their Pack, and they don't give up on what they have together.,Learning more about Sienna, and what she has grown up with, what she's grown up expecting - to die before she reaches 25 - was heart-wrenching at times. And yet she always managed to impress me with the way she's managed to become such a strong young woman. She is absolutely more than a match for Hawke. But she's so much more than a perfect match for him, she's a fierce, beautiful, determined, resourceful woman that's not afraid to take chances with her heart, and will protect those she cares about, no matter the cost to herself.",,Kiss of Snow (Psy/Changeling Series Book 10)

The parts where the Snow Dancer's make preemptive strikes against the Psy and the final battle was both climactic and emotionally intense. And I enjoyed seeing Lucas and Sascha, and was thrilled to witness their new arrival and what a powerful nurturing instinct the baby stirs up in all of the predatory Changelings.,Now to Hawke and Sienna, while I wasn't exactly disappointed, their story isn't exactly what I'd hoped for either. Some of the intensity that Singh builds early on (and has been building for several books) is lessened by trying to draw the tension out way too long. Multiple times Singh stokes the fire between Hawke and Sienna and puts them in a situations where emotions (and attraction) are running high and then fades to black, leaving us wonder how they managed to avoid taking the next step when there has always been the feeling that should Hawke ever lower his barriers even for an instant, his wolf would claim Sienna in the most primal way. Add to that frequent interruptions every time that things start to get hot and heavy between them later in the book, plus thread switches to other story lines, and the result is that when they finally do come together it just wasn't as explosive as it could have been had some of the earlier situations been allowed to reach their natural conclusions.",,Kiss of Snow (Psy/Changeling Series Book 10)

In Sienna's case, life free of the Silence Protocol is both a precious gift and an incredible threat.  For Sienna is an X-Psy, a rare designation whose powers leave her a ticking time bomb.  Sienna can't ever give into her powers, not when doing so would not only kill her, but everyone around her.  At nineteen, Sienna is far older than her years.  Nothing can shatter her control.  Nothing except Hawke.,At fifteen, wolf changeling Hawke became alpha of a broken pack.  His history is steeped in bloodshed, pain, and loss, but from that foundation he worked to make SnowDancer into one of the most powerful packs in the world.  Though he loves his pack, Hawke is, in many ways, a lone wolf.  Wolves only mate once and Hawke lost the girl who would be his mate during childhood.  Yet something about the beautiful, brilliant Sienna calls to Hawke in a way he cannot push aside.  She knocks him off balance, making him want things he knows he cannot - should not - have.  So he puts distance between them, burying his desire for Sienna.,Only Sienna will no longer be ignored.  She wants all or nothing and Hawke knows that if he turns her away, he'll lose her forever.  One kiss is all it takes for their passion to blaze out of control.  But before Hawke and Sienna have a chance to explore what's growing between them, an enemy launches a vicious attack that endangers everything the lovers hold dear.

I positively cannot wait for the sequel.  I'm shocked not to have found anything else by Kim Harrison out already, considering just how great this was.  Amazing first effort.  Amazing effort, period. I was a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan on the Anita Blake series, though recent efforts have been a disappointment.  This was, for me, as much fun as early LKH.  Similarly, it was a strong, funny, female character, in a supernatural alternate modern reality with fangs, and fur, and fey. That, however, is where the similarities end, as this actually managed to be unique, with its own wonderful voice and style, and a whole new alternate world, like no other I've seen. The book was strong on plot, with lots of nice twists and turns, had wonderful, enjoyable, well thought out and developed characters, well described scenes, and plenty of action. The magic and magical beings were both impressive, and at times, hysterically amusing. (I will not post a spoiler, of course, on what her shape changing spell does, but suffice to say, it's original, and it's pretty darned funny!) The Pixie that the main character, Rachel Morgan, partners with is a blast, and at the same time, sympathetic.  I loved the blend.  She gave the characters, even those other than Rachel, some real dimension.  She also made the character Rachel come across as someone whose fate you could care about.

I like the Ivy/Rachel relationship in the story but that falls flat, it's a tease,  it's like the author just dropped it all together for a more conventional romance. The biggest problem I had with this book is the last part of the book. I felt that the author brought in a character, Nick, just to bring in a typical romance hero good, appearing, guy, who Rachel falls for instantly and trusts without reservation.  I just felt that introduction of the character brought strong confident Rachel to be a weak kneed romance heroine. I believe that Harrison can remedy that in the next book, and I'm looking forward to it.

When her evil stepmother decides to try other lands for fortune, Elena is abandoned and forced to come up with a future of her own. She decides to become a servant--and at least get paid for working for others. Instead, a Fairy Godmother takes her on as an apprentice. The magical potential that has built up in her through the frustrated tradition gives her huge magical powers. Which she'll need, because tradition forces the inhabitants of her kingdoms into preset ways--some of which are positive and nice, but others of which are quite dark and evil. Elena, even aided by brownies and unicorns, has a lot to do.,When Prince Alexander behaves rudely to what he thinks is an old woman but is really Elena in test mode, she turns him into a donkey and brings him home to reform him. Which is fine as long as Alexander stays a donkey, but when he turns back into a man, attraction sizzles, which is a problem. Tradition doesn't hold with Fairy Godmothers having lovers, at least not lovers who don't betray them. And Elena is determined not to follow that tradition.,Author Mercedes Lackey melds together a number of fairy tale traditions to create a compelling story of fairie, magic, and romance. Elena is a strong character, who, as her brownies point out, would be wasted in the largely decorative role of princess. Alexander starts out something of a jerk, but manages to redeem himself through hard work and serious thought. A strong action sequence closes out the story answering readers who wonder whether Elena and Alexander will be able to create a new tradition where they can explore the strong attraction between them.",,"The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1)"

I don't think that this novel was intended to be an Epic Tale or a Deep Story. What it turns out to be is a fun and engaging story that puts a delightfully wry spin on the classic fairy tales that most of us grew up with. Dry humor is present in abundance, and I spent much of the time that I was reading the book in a state of simple delight. What brings together the admittedly improbable elements of a fairy tale? Where do Fairy Godmothers/Good Fairies come from? MUST they always be single? What happens when fairy tales ALMOST happen? What would happen if two lines of ""fairy tale"" mythology (West European and Russian, for example) bumped into eachother? Lackey comes up with creative answers to all of those questions, and manages to keep a sense of fun flowing through this story of frustrated archetypes, unexpeced romance, fairy tale micro-management, and magical trouble-shooting.",,"The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1)"

Then again, to the right person, the tales of Valdemar could be considered fairy tales.  At first I wasn't sure if I would even like the book.  When I got to reading it, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  In fact, I read it twice in the week I had it from the library.  The realm of fairy godmothers is pretty much unexplored.  Mercedes gives it the realism of a responsible job done by responsible people with an affinity for seeing possibilities and working with the forces to ensure that any outcome is as far on the side of goodness as they can manage it.  True, it dispells a little of the mythos of the fairy godmother as a being who can create instant miracles for all of her charges.  However, it is a very entertaining and enjoyable book.  I look forward to the paperback edition coming out so that I can add it to my personal library.",,"The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1)"

Any fan of Mercedes Lackey, fairy tales and/or GOOD stories will enjoy this.,In the Five Hundred kingdoms, 'The Tradition' rules. It is nearly an unstoppable force. If the lives of any individual in the kingdoms begins to resemble that of a fairy tale, the Tradition gathers force to bring that story to its proper fairy tale conclusion.,Elena Klovis has an evil stepmother and two stepsisters, and is well on the way to becoming Cinderella. However, the prince of her kingdom is only 11 years old! Unable to fulfill her destiny, Elena ends up as a fairy godmother's apprentice. Though Elena is now outside Tradition, it is still determined that she should somehow fulfill her destiny, while Elena struggles to bring 'happliy ever afters' to other people in her kingdom with or without the Tradition's help.,This novel was really, really well written. I simply couldn't put it down. Elena is charming and hardworking, sensible (but not too sensible!) and kind. Everyone in the novel was well-written, from Sergei the little horse, to Arachnia,the evil Sorceress, to Alexander the haughty prince, to the unicorns, who were cutely dopey. Everytime I thought something wouldn't be explained, it was! Everything happened satisfactorily. Watching Elena manipulate the Tradition( one of Ms. Lackey's more interesting characters, although it's not quite sentient) was very entertaining. The Tradition is like Destiny, but more obvious and immensely powerful, not to mention stubborn. It's not always a good thing, as some of the fairytales it steers people into are quite nasty. It's just a force, for good or ill.",,"The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1)"

Not to mention this one has come much sooner than expected!  But if I'm being honest, this is probably my toughest review yet.  It's taken me so long to get it together because I just keep drawing a blank. Part of it is because this is the end of my favorite series ever.  But I have accepted that this must happen to all good things, or else they could risk not being so good anymore.,Kim Harrison brought this novel back around to be about the vamps. She made good on her promise compared to other recent books where they sat more on the back burner.  It appears to be for good reason though because vampires are the key to changing everything. There were some revelations that truly surprised me and the unpredictable twists kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time.,I was happy to see the demons and elves get a healthy dose of focus as well.  Over the years I have grown very attached to their story lines and was happy to see they wouldn't have too many loose ends.,Rachel and Trent. Yeah, if you're a fan I don't see why that would stop now!  They display great teamwork and definitely turn up the heat as they're settling into their relationship together.  It's satisfying to see but still hard to believe it's happened considering the long road they took to find one another.  Of course it still isn't easy for them.  They have very complicated lives, but their determination to make it work just gives a girl all the feels in the world.,Rachel takes her relationships seriously and her friends and family are as strong as ever.

And the finale does not disappoint. I must confess I had some trepidation, like most 'modern magic' series a lot of mythology and additional mumbo jumbo had been added since the beginning of the series. Unbelievably, Harrison manages to pull together not only the characters but the mythos to make a coherent and epic story. There are only a couple of wee beefs - the story is heavy on talking rather than action - I guess being the last of the series there is much focus on relationship resolution (also handled brilliantly) rather than snappy action (there is still a good dose) Also the epilogue is a block of cheese, then again after 13 odd best-selling books and several much loved characters, how else to end? The scariest thing is it doesn't seem that long ago I picked up the first two books of The Hollows and delighted in a decent alternative to the Anita Blake series (which everyone wishes ended) Harrison it seems has picked the perfect time to exit The Witch, before fans tire and/or she evolves into ridiculousness.

SPOILERS.  SPOILERS. SPOILERS. I had a lot of trouble finishing this last one. I have loved and cherished every bloody book of this series and I hated this ending. Not the fact that Trent and Rachel finally became happy. None of that, but how they got there... As per usual Ms Harrison is an amazing writer and I have no issues with language or dialogue in itself but what happened to all those characters? Rachel did nothing but whine throughout the book, how undeserving she was, how everything was her fault and how all she wanted was for Ivy to be happy. Trent became this star-crossed lover, not ever opposing Rachel, being super supportive. I missed their quarrels, their arguments, everything that made them different! A lot of what happened didn't make sense to me... I mean did I miss things? Where does Ellasbeth fit in? What happened to the evil elves? Re-instating Magic and one vampire holding the soul of an undead is it? the answer to it all? How and why did Newt become? There are so many things I didn't understand. Before everything was logical and comprehensively explained. I hate saying these things but I can't well pretend I liked it. I mean I spent FIVE days trying to finish it... I have to say my all over feel is that every single character was FORCED to a happy ending and nothing just seemed to follow its course. Things needed to change drastically and drastic is exactly what happened. I would have preferred two installments instead of one, hoping that maybe things would have felt more logical. I don't begrudge them their happy ending, I just find it too convenient. Everyone is a critic and I know that people will think i'm crazy... but it's the impression that was left in my hind brain.

I felt nothing was wrapped up for me, I was left with a lot of questions of why didn't she talk about what happened to...The whole time I read this series the books kept talking about Al's Butterfly Chrysalis which I thought there was a deeper meaning to what the chrysalis was, I thought maybe it was Al's dead wife's soul? That maybe Rachel was going to find a way to bring her back to life so Al wouldn't have to be alone anymore. But nope the chrysalis meant nothing even though she alluded to it multiple times thru out the series. That didn't happen. Then she never said anything about Jinx and Belle. She alluded that Jinx and Belle were getting closer, I thought maybe a romantic relationship. That didn't happen. There definitely wasn't enough SEX in this series, there sure was a lot of snuggling,kissing and wanting to have sex, but I kept feeling like I was reading a young adult series because they would never 'get it on' much. I hated that Al in the end was an actor/director. WHAT? really? The Goddess was too easy to kill/change. She never talked about what happened to the ever after once Rachael did recreate it. Did she make the ever after a beautiful place or was it still a waste land with the stink of burnt amber? I wanted the demons to find females again so they could be happy, she never finished that story line. She didn't say anything about Bis in the end either.

No, I mean I REALLY love this series! A quick rundown of its finer points: It's got action, though not over the top. It has a smidgeon of romance that lends a slight sensitive air to an often dangerous and suspenseful atmosphere. It has amazingly strong characters, from villain to heroine, that make you feel and know who they really are. And finally, though never least, it has a solid plot that advances satisfactorily with each progressive installment.,Rachel Morgan has had some tough issues to deal with in less than one year. She's been marked for death by the organization that she once worked for and survived. She's been marked and almost claimed by a rather nasty demon, yet managed to best even that complex being. And so achingly close to home, she's still coming to terms with her scattered love life, confusingly twisted around her roommate Ivy, her lover Kisten and former boyfriend Nick. It's not a love triangle, but it comes durn close! When her estranged partner, Jenks, comes on board for one last run, they're off to Michigan to pull Nick and one of Jenks' sons out of trouble. As always with our dear, flawed Rachel, she gets way more than she bargained for and soon they're fending off the unwanted attentions of some disturbingly unified Were packs. Why are the Weres uniting and what will it bring as the normally submissive species climbs its way towards top of the supernatural food chain? Nothing good for the vamps, which have much to lose if the packs do unite. With ultra aggressive Weres sniping from every direction, and more undead looking on her with not so subtle lust, what's a poor earth witch to do? With Rachel, it's an open book and fans may be surprised at the lengths she's willing to go to in this one.",,"A Fistful of Charms (The Hollows, Book 4)"

She is forced to use a demonic curse in order to Were so she can maintain her status as Alpha of David's pack and keep her insurance rates affordable.  After crossing this line once, it is an easy slide to continue using demonic curses.,  Rachel finds out that her former pixy partner, Jenks, has a son, Jax, who is lost somewhere up north.  Jax has teamed up with Rachel's ex-boyfriend and ex-familiar, Nick Sparagmos, to steal an artifact that now has the Weres ready to kill him.  Rachel once again resorts to a demonic curse and transforms Jenks into a human sized pixy for their rescue of Jax and Nick.  The situation quickly gets complicated when it turns out that the stolen artifact is one that could tip the balance of power between the Inderlanders.  Rachel, Jenks, and Ivy will have to quickly develop a plan that keeps everyone safe while maintaining the balance of power.,  A FISTFUL OF CHARMS shows a more introspective side of Rachel.  Rachel uses quite a few demonic curses in this novel and the resulting stain on her soul makes her re-examine her entire life.  She is also struggling with her relationship with Ivy.  Ivy is obviously attracted to Rachel whereas Rachel is only interested in friendship.  However, Rachel recognizes that Ivy needs blood as a living vampire and therefore is hoping to find some sort of blood balance with Ivy.  This dilemma results in quite a bit of introspection from both Ivy and Rachel.,  A FISTFUL OF CHARMS can be read as a stand alone novel but will probably rate lower to readers new to the series.

There are complications - Rachel and Ivy explore their relationship, Rachel and Jenks have to deal with their break, and we get more insight into Nick, some of which is only hinted at in the second and third books.  Also, we see Rachel continue to struggle between her abilities and her morals.  Overall, the book is interesting, a good read, and a good progression of the characters, but it wasn't quite as compelling as the first three.

Rachel tries to play around with Kisten, knowing what she does about vampires and pheromones, and ""doesn't realize"" she's pushing him too far. Rachel jerks Ivy around for yet *another* book, this time with nearly disastrous results. Rachel, in other words, is her usual self-centered, short-sighted self. I can't understand why anyone would want to help her/ work with her/sleep with her; I can't understand why anyone wants to *know* her.

In one power play after the next, Rachel's about to fall behind enemy lines, instead of the one step ahead we've been seeing.,It's back to Cincinnati after her desperate attempt to save her pixie partner's son and her ex-boyfriend, Nick. Rachel harbors a rather nasty curse trapped in a bone prison, the focus, which threatens to twist the realities of Weres and vampires alike, both of whom squabble over it like children. With Trent vying for it, someone killing for it and our favorite demon Al lusting after it, Rachel once again has to find a way to undo another problem forced upon her. As the delicate balance between her and Ivy begins to come to a roiling boil, it's all the earth witch can do to stay this side of good, acceptable magic. With her special blood and desire to help others though, it's near impossible for her to deflect the trouble that comes looking for her with a vengeance. Unable to unload the focus on just anyone, she'll have to decide who's the best choice...and none of them are looking particularly stellar.,The first of Harrison's series to be offered in hardback, it's a worthy installment for it, tipping the scales even further towards excellent. For a Few Demons More wraps up some of the problems that Rachel has been having over the course of the other books while of course unraveling others even further. Trent comes back into play and it's a totally different side of him than readers have read before. Ceri, the powerful ex-demon familiar, shows Rachel just how much she respects her and Rachel's pack mate David takes on a major role.",,"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, Book 5)"

If you've been losing patience, hold on for just a bit longer, b/c this is where it gets good. Right. So Trent's getting married to Ellasbeth, and he wants Rachel to work security for the wedding, b/c Lee RVSPed to his Best Man invite. This is a problem, b/c Lee is Al's new familiar in the Ever After, so how's he going to pull off being in Trent's wedding? An excellent question. It's also a question that has Trent understandably nervous, and as Rachel is the only person to ever hold her own against Al, Trent wants her in place to handle whatever unknown, yet inevitable, shenanigans Al is planning. Rachel says, ""Hell NO. It's my birthday."" Trent says, ""40k."" Rachel says, ""Well, maybe . . . but I better not have to wear an ugly dress."" B/c Rachel isn't just working security from the sidelines in a Quen-like capacity, oh no, she's doing it as one of Ellasbeth's bridesmaids. *giggle snorts* I hadn't really thought about it before, but a fellow fan of The Hollows commented on one of my status updates on Goodreads that this book is a real turning point for the series. On the one hand, yeah, obviously (b/c the Bad Thing happens in this book). But there is a LOT more going on than that. Al is in trouble with the demons, and he wants Rachel's help getting out of it. Ceri and Trent finally meet. Rachel upsets the balance of power between the heavy hitting Supes. Skimmer does the other Big Thing . . . And don't let ALL THE THINGS scare you, b/c unlike True Blood, Season 4's hodgepodge of overwhelming randomness, For a Few Demons More is wonderfully coherent, and by far, the best book in the series up to that point. YEP. This is where it starts getting REALLY good.",,"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, Book 5)"

Alas, another series bites the dust.,I almost didn't read this book, as I had a sinking feeling, based on the slow downward spiral in the series. Unfortunately, this trend has hit a new low with this book.,The actual plot threads are confusing, overly plotted, in most cases not resolved. Almost all the  action takes place off-screen (and reported to us later), while we are treated to a series of lectures about how Rachel should have sex with Ivy. Also, the editor/proofers seem to have taken a couple of days off, as the errors (blue eyes - no - brown eyes; you for your; unneeded words left in when a sentence was rewritten; etc.) were shockingly sprinkled throughout the book - unusual for a series this prominent.,Spoilers alert,This series started out great, but each book fell off a bit. The characters, so interesting in the initial book, just didn't develop.,I'd hoped characters that showed promise but were underdeveloped would blossom, but except for quirky, sudden changes, they remained stock characters. Ivy - the tortured vamp friend with angst coming out her pretty little ears until you want to choke her. Kisten, the weak, needy vamp lover who never gets a chance to develop. Piscary, the evil master vamp - we know he's evil, because people tell us things he does off-screen. Trent, the conscience-free rich elf scientist - is he good? evil? both? David, the stalwart alpha were. - call central casting! Etc.,I'd hoped story arcs would resolve, while allowing characters to become fleshed out. To be blunt, neither of these things happened. The major story arcs just keep arcing like fireworks, while an occasional new element is suddenly plunked down like a dead fish.",,"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, Book 5)"

I only finished because I am too stubborn and curious for my own good. The heroine- if you can call her that- is a teeny tiny woman with incredibly large eyes and a great ass (according to the male characters description anyway- don't writers like to write of any other type of woman?), who is continually praised as being smart and brave, but does nothing to deserve that reputation. She seemed sort of stupid and helpless to me, and I am sick of reading weak female leads. The 'killer' was obvious from the start, along with who they wanted us to think was the bad guy, it was all really predictable. Add to that a psychic uncle and the fact that her new 'rescuer' is an ex cop, who has just inherited millions - and it makes the bad language and explicit sex scene seems like only a small problem.

Her employer Jack is an ex-cop who knows something is very wrong and tries to gain her trust - a task which seems impossible at times. He does make some progress with her children though.  The scenes between 7 year old Katie and Jack are particularly touching in a book which goes way over to the dark side in other places. The children and Jack are the best parts of the book.

I like romantic suspense and the plot sounded good, so I said, Yes. Oh my goodness, I had no idea what a treat I was in for. I loved this book. The plot is FANTASTIC. The action is non-stop. I was riveted to the book from the moment I started it until I sadly reached the final page. It was one of those books that I did not want to end because it was so good.,I absolutely fell in love with these characters, Beth and her kids Katie & Ben, who are so obviously scarred and scared from the abuse they have suffered. It is painful to watch how they all react to human touch and how they have so obviously been traumatized.,Then there is Jack....ooh, I adored Jack. Jack is a police detective who has been forced into retirement after a car accident left him with a bum (and painful) knee. He is a protector at heart, and although he has been thrown into this situation with Beth and her kids out of the blue, he can see that something has hurt them and doesn't have the heart to turn them out. Watching him slowly and steadily win over this family is a gorgeous thing to read. Between him and his dog, Henry (the failed police dog,) they are exactly what this family needs and they quickly discover that they need the family too.,There is also a great cast of supporting characters whom I loved, especially the depth that they added to the story:,*Quinn & Sean- Jack's cousins,*James- Beth's uncle,*Mrs. Harris- Jack's housekeeper,The suspense story line has a lot going on with it. There is Beth's abusive and murderous Senator husband who is after them, but there is also a serial killer that has Beth in his sights.",,"She Can Run (She Can Series, Book 1)"

Beth accepts a job as a caretaker on a remote Pennsylvania estate, only to arrive just ahead of a storm, to be greeted by a hearse at the front door. The old gentleman who hired her has died, leaving his estate to his wounded ex-cop nephew, who isn't even sure that he wants to live there. So there she is, using an assumed name, trying to protect herself and her children from her husband, who is trying to kill her before she can make his biggest secret fodder for the media. Now she may have nowhere to go, and if she stays on the estate, she will have to deal with an ex-cop who is more interested in her than she cares for. The story line is fairly good - wife on the run, violent husband with a secret, injured ex-cop who is all to interested in her, and a serial killer that is targeting small, dark haired women just like her. Then there are the neighbors - single men, one who seems okay, and one who is verbally abusive and way too aggressive. One downside, for me, anyway, was that there are far too many sex scenes, and the general presentation of sex throughout the book is too graphic. The other downside was that it was a bit too easy to figure out what the nature of the husband's secret, and who the serial killer actually is. Other than that, I found the book interesting in that it combines mystery, romance and a touch of the paranormal. A nice read to just sit back and relax.",,"She Can Run (She Can Series, Book 1)"

The 3 ring pool is pleny large for splashing around, and can easily hold our daughter, both parents, and an armada of toys.  It is also easy to empty, by stepping on one side and letting the water run out.

It was pretty inexpensive compared to the other small pools so I didn't expect much. It's small enough to fit on our deck but big enough for a few kids to play in. Took maybe 5 minutes to blow up. If you have a bicycle pump it will take no time at all. Each ring is inflated separately and the bottom inflates as well. Would make for a great ball pit after the summer! Few things to consider... 1. The bottom does inflate which is great for those with toddlers. It will stay inflated if the water line stays below the first ring. If the water goes above that you will not get that nice squishy inflated bottom. The water smashes it down. It wasn't a big issue for us since we keep it pretty shallow to begin with but something to keep in mind if your kids like their pools to be on the deeper side. 2. It does not have a drain (I have yet to find an inflatable pool that does). 3. After blowing up the rings and pushing in the plastic closers they started opening back up on their own. I found that they stay put if you leave those plastic closures sticking out rather than pushing them in. 4. The pool is very soft and doesn't seem very durable. I was worried how many times we would be able to use it before it popped but so far no issues! My son is the typical rough toddler and this past weekend we had some older kids playing in it. After each use I unplug the closures to let a little air out and then step on side to let the water flow out so it can dry out. So far no holes to report. If you plan on using this directly on grass it might be a good idea to put down a tarp first. I could see small sticks being an issue for the bottom. 5. Having a lot of people over for a cook out? Don't inflate the bottom - just the three rings. Throw in a bunch of ice and store the drinks in there. Makes for a great outdoor cooler.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VMsGI3oVL._SX300_.jpg,"Intex Kiddie Pool - Kid's Summer Sunset Glow Design - 58"" x 13"""

The reason we decided to order this pool was primarily because this pool had a nice inflateable bottom which we thought would be nice for our 2 year old boys. Unfortunately, once we filled it with water, perhaps due to the weight of the water, the bottom (floor) of the pool lost all the air and went flat! So we were no better off spending double dollar amount on this pool. Thats not all, the lower most ring loses pressure, and semi collapses, perhaps due to the water weight so thats another negative. Lastly, this pool has NO water drain plug !!!  This is a gross oversight on the manufacturers part and no where in the description do they make this clear. While it may not sound like a big thing, but try draining a filled out pool by tilting - its nearly impossible because the tubing doesnt take the weight of water and wont tilt over without getting damaged - the only way we have figured out so far is that I press down on one side with my foot and stand there for a few minutes while the water drains out over my foot - and I am sure its not good for the structural integrity of the pool. Eventually its not a fortune spent, but the wasted time and inconvenience caused. (Unfortunately after we saw that the pool inflated fine the first time, we discarded the packing material  - so returning this is not an option anymore) Would love to hear from others if someone has found a good pool which will last us through the season.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VMsGI3oVL._SX300_.jpg,"Intex Kiddie Pool - Kid's Summer Sunset Glow Design - 58"" x 13"""

Harrison has done it again and raised the stakes ever higher with her latest and greatest Hallows book. It's hard to believe this is only book six; it feels like Rachel's character has been with us forever and she only gets more ""real"" as the series continues. As surely as Rachel twists curses to get herself out of yet another sore spot, Harrison is twisting readers into an absolute fit of excitement with her wicked way with words.,The Outlaw Demon Wails wastes no time and swings into the demon action with the very first chapter. With a trio of sneezes from Rachel, Al's back in crushed green velvet and as ready to wreak havoc as ever. It's October and as the Hallows and Cincinatti residents prepare for the week-long Halloween festivities, Rachel is once again fending off Al's rigorously murderous attentions. Someone is letting him lose from his ever-after jail cell and Rachel has to find out who has it in for her enough to do so. The list of possibilities is long, to say the least. And suddenly, not only is Rachel in danger, but everyone she loves and cares about are too. With guilt and heartache weighing heavily on her with Kisten's demise, not to mention more than one shocking family secret, Rachel is mentally and physically tired. And when a desperate witch just can't take anymore, she'll do anything to save those she loves.,I'd been hearing that at one time this was to be the end of the series, and therefore we'd be seeing a lot of the subplots wrapped up with this installment (even though Harrison's contract has now been extended--which hey, is awesome!). Frankly, I don't agree that that many of them were really wrapped up enough to truly put away.",,"The Outlaw Demon Wails (The Hollows, Book 6)"
http://www.amazon.com/Outlaw-Demon-Wails-Hollows-Book/dp/0061149829,I dislike the new narrator!!!,http://www.amazon.com/Outlaw-Demon-Wails-Hollows-Book/product-reviews/0061149829," on August 8, 2008","  I enjoyed Kim Harrison books when they first came out.  I was looking for more romance, but the story line was great so I bypassed that.  I then fell in love with the books when I started to listen to them on my mp3 player.  The old narrator, Marguerite Gavin, did such a great job of bringing Rachel to life.  I felt more like I knew all of the characters completely and I was just a bystander in their life.   With this latest book, the narrator has changed.  Her name is Gigi Birmingham.  I HATE HOW SHE READS RACHEL!!!!  The first 10-15 minutes into the audiobook I noticed that Gigi reads rachel like she is a 16 or 17 year old.  It doesn't help that the first scene is rachel with her mother, that just increased ""rachels"" (gigi's) childlike behavior and manner of speaking.  Also, Gigi makes Jenks voice really high pitch.  It doesn't sound right.  PLUS, SHE MISPRONOUNCES WORDS.  Having listened to the first 5 books read by Marguerite Gavin, I may have become accustomed to the mispronouced words.  Hearing Gigi pronouce them differently, DRIVES ME UP THE WALL.  She can't even say the word adult right, she completely butchers Piscary's and Takata's names.  I may just be used to the way that margeurite said them, but there should be some fluidity between the 6 books, and pronounciation should be fluid between them all.  I am totally disheartened at how this new narrator just does not get Rachel and has totally portrayed her incorrectly.  I will not purchase the next audiobook if Gigi reads it again.  The narrator makes or breaks a book, Gigi mutilated this one.  I think I am going to stop listening to the audio and read the book instead, maybe I will enjoy the book better.",,"The Outlaw Demon Wails (The Hollows, Book 6)"

It's pretty strange going from Lateralus (their most progressive) to Opiate (their ""simplest""). It must have been very interesting for fans who started at the beginning and watched this remarkable band grow into the powerhouses they are now.,At face value, Undertow seems simple and heavy, pulled down because of a muddy mix that never seems to raise the guitars above a buzz or Maynard James Keenan's voice to the heights where it should soar. It's more song-oriented than the multifaceted epics of Lateralus and even ::whoa!:: catchy at times. I love the rapid, quick-fingered picking of the infectious main riff for ""Bottom"". Heavy stuff can have hooks too, right?,At face value...,Undertow, however, is a pretty rich heavy metal album. Only traces of the alternative/grunge sound hover around Undertow's edges -- mainly the production style and some of the riffs. But in most respects, this is very much a metal record. Intellectually, however, Tool steps well beyond most metal bands with innovative musical intricacies and astute lyrics. Keenan is one of the most powerful vocalists in rock/metal, and his delivery is perfectly dramatic on songs like ""Sober"" (with its powerful ending) and ""Crawl Away"", where he whispers and roars. Adam Jones is a very unique guitarist, not playing conventional solos, and usually basing his playing on just a few chords per song. However, Tool is more about band interplay than individual playing: Danny Carey's exact and meticulous drumming; Paul d'Amour's gritty, growling bass; Jones' scratching guitar sounds, silent nuance, or earsplitting power chords. The title track is the most dynamic musically, with clever riffs and awesome vocals.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mJt4IVkhL._SX300_.jpg,Undertow
http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/dp/B000000993,"A wonderful, touching, and chilling CD",http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/product-reviews/B000000993," on December 14, 1999","  Tool is amazing. They write complex, emotional music, never sound corny, and they can flat-out run a chill down your spine. This particular album is more of a straight rock approach to their brand of music, as opposed to the  heavy distortion of Ænima. It's tough to comapre the two albums because of  this difference, but one thing I can pick out is that I like the bass  better on Undertow. It is used to great effect; one example of this is on  ""Intolerence"", where the bass keeps the flow of the song  together, allowing the guitar to play more complicated and varied riffs.  The vocals by Keenan are simply astounding : he can sing soft and  beautifully, and conversely go all out and yell. During all of the yelling,  however, he never sounds untalented; he is able to keep the high quality of  his voice. That's very rare to find these days. And last but certainly not  least, Danny Carey's heart-pounding drums are able to pick a song up from a  slow melody to all out rage and then slow it back down again. If they  continue on the path that Undertow and Ænima have beaten out for them,  their new album (which is rumored to have been in production since October  '99) will be something special indeed.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mJt4IVkhL._SX300_.jpg,Undertow
http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/dp/B000000993,Excellent chronicle of Tool's early career,http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/product-reviews/B000000993," on May 7, 2006","There is no common opinion on what is the best Tool album. Some will say they got better with each release, while some others think their first two releases, Opiate and Undertow, are better and more musical. Without getting into this debate, I'll kindly suggest, if you've never heard Tool before, start right here, with their first full-length release, Undertow (their debut Opiate is an EP).,The songs on Undertow are all significantly more simple and direct than their work on Aenima and Lateralus; it could be argued that the band hadn't matured fully while they were writing these songs yet, but still, for a 1993 release, Undertow is one of the most innovative discs ever, given how the scene was littered with a million grunge bands at the time. This is not to say Tool has no alternative elements in their music though. The second track of the album actually sees vocalist Maynard Keenan opting for a slightly grunge-styled delivery with great results. However, aside from that, ""Prison Sex"" is an ultimately adventurous piece and easily transcends the boundaries of grunge. Pairing a gritty bass motif with immensely powerful drum fills, the song also contains a dynamic guitar theme that soars above this combination, climaxing at the final second, suggesting there is not a single overplayed note on it.,Actually, Undertow, as every other Tool album, immediately impacts the listener with its solid rhythmic angle, the amazing Danny Carey on drums and Paul D'Amour on bass (now replaced by Justin Chancellor).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mJt4IVkhL._SX300_.jpg,Undertow
http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/dp/B000000993,My reluctant favorite of the quartet.,http://www.amazon.com/Undertow-TOOL/product-reviews/B000000993," on February 25, 1999","  As a long-time fan of the band, I've chosen to spotlight this album in an Amazon review. I've seen Tool seven times live, once at Lollapalooza, once at Ozzfest and the rest at their own shows. Undertow is undoubtedly the  most powerful, thought-provoking album these guys have assembled, but I  would also prescribe any other of their masterpieces. Maynard's voice is an  instrument, a vehicle, that takes the listener to dark places. He is the  tragic king of his own world, and he makes you feel like he's been through  something the rest of us only have nightmares about. The lyrics make you  dig into yourself, introspect, realize what's there and what isn't and  should be. Danny Carey's percussion lines provide powerful punctuation to  Adam Jones' amazing guitar riffs and Paul D'amour's (now replaced by Justin  Chancellor's) bass beats. The bass, in this album and Aenima particularly,  is the engine of the music. The pure genius of Adam Jones, the brain child  of this band, is recognizeable in any of their videos or songs. Rarely does  one find a band that speaks to listeners like Tool. One of their most powerful messages is that through  introspection, you realize your true potential in what you do and who you  are-- so don't be a sheep. Don't follow the crowd, or take things for  granted. No one told you to come. This is necessary; life feeds on life. If  you can't get the messages, can't appreciate the music for what it is,  don't get this album or any of their others. If you are open-minded and you  can read between the lines, listen to Tool.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mJt4IVkhL._SX300_.jpg,Undertow
