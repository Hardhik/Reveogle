http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T5-Professional/dp/B00J34YO92,I love my Canon Rebel T5,http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T5-Professional/product-reviews/B00J34YO92, on December 27  2014,"I love my Canon Rebel T5! I am an enthusiast learning and advancing through digital photography. This bundle package was a good choice for me. I have been taking digital photography for over 8 years  but I was using Canon Power Shots and decided this year to make the right choice into DSLR cameras. At first  the amount of functions and buttons scared me a bit  but with a lot of study and practice  my understanding has increased leaps and bounds. Enough about me  about the Rebel T5 bundle package. 1) The camera is great. If you are new to DSLRs  you should get this package. I understand that there are other higher end models such as the 7D Mark II  6D  and 5D Mark III  but unless you are a professional photographer  it can be difficult to justify the extra cost just to have the most expensive camera. First learning how to control shutter speed  aperture  ISO  evaluative metering  lighting  file size types for prints  and white balance all goes a long way towards one's education on digital photography. The 18-55mm and 75-300mm lenses were good addition to the package. Keep in mind  that although these lenses will more than likely blow out the quality of your cell phone and tablet cameras  these lenses are basic models and still fail in comparison to the ""Red Ring"" lenses. 2) The two SD Cards were good  but never used them because I bought a 64GB. My preference 3) The Vivitar Flash was subpar  so I bought the 270EX II 4) The Remote Control is good add on  just not wireless 5) The bag was okay  but too small because of other camera equipment that I now have.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C6A2Aei5L._SY300_.jpg,Canon EOS Rebel T5 18MP EF-S Digital SLR Camera USA warranty with canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS [Image Stabilizer] II Zoom Lens & EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens + 58mm 2x Professional Lens +High Definition 58mm Wide Angle Lens + Auto Power Flash + UV Filter Kit with 24GB Complete Deluxe Accessory Bundle

http://www.amazon.com/Sony-W800-Digital-Camera-Black/dp/B00I8BIBCW,A good snapshot device for its price...,http://www.amazon.com/Sony-W800-Digital-Camera-Black/product-reviews/B00I8BIBCW, on August 28  2014,I am an amateur photographer and own three DSLR cameras with a selection of lenses. However that collection does not eliminate the need for a handy item for just daily needs. I keep this one especially in my car's glove box as a reserve for occasions which require something better than my cell phone camera. For that purpose it meets my expectations and even exceeds it. Yet  this is still a snap shot device with a relatively low price tag and therefore  a DSLR level quality (like background blurring  high shutter speed  high level of low light performance etc.)should not be expected. Pros: -Lightweight slim and  stylish design: It can fit in small spaces and look and feel like a high quality item. -USB charging ability: That is one of the selling points for me. I keep it in my car and I don't want to run out of power any time or go through the hassle of removing the battery and charging it separately  which requires carrying the charging adapter all the time and also the ability to plug in that adapter. Instead. all I do is to connect it to my 12V car USB charger and it pretty quickly accumulates good amount of charge level... It comes with a wall adapter (5V 0.5A) which connects to a detachable USB cable (so you can use the cable and attach it to any USB charger). But be careful about the USB cable. The standard USB-micro B cable that charges most mobile devices do not work for this type. If you need a replacement or an extra you need to buy a USB-UC E6 cable. -Easy menu mode: Practicality should be the main focus in a snapshot device and even my grandfather could get through this menu. One of the most user-friendly interfaces I have seen so far. -Panoramic shoot ability: That was a surprise for me.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RouO%2BYEgL._SX300_.jpg,Sony W800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black)

http://www.amazon.com/Sony-W800-Digital-Camera-Black/dp/B00I8BIBCW,A promising camera that under-delivers,http://www.amazon.com/Sony-W800-Digital-Camera-Black/product-reviews/B00I8BIBCW, on July 23  2014,I ordered this camera with high hopes after seeing it was the #1 selling camera on Amazon at the time of purchase  and after reading many 4-star and 5-star reviews.  The camera I received was clearly the same product shown online  but I feel like I am reviewing an entirely different product than the one I expected to receive. I'll start with what the camera does well: it does fit in the small hip pocket of my backpack  which was a prerequisite as this was to be my camera for long-distance backpacking trips.  It does have good battery life  as I was not able to deplete the battery on a 3-day trip with probably 100+ photos taken.  It does have a useful  though low-resolution panorama mode for those who don't want to make the effort to combine multiple photos using image processing software.  Beyond those few features  I found the camera to be relatively lackluster and uninspiring. My beef with this camera started the very first time I turned it on.  I was greeted by a persistent and distracting screen flicker that I have not seen in any other camera.  I am surprised others have not mentioned this  though perhaps I received a defective unit.  I know it wasn't just my eyes  I showed it to my wife and she agreed it was flickering.  After several hours of use  the flickering seemed to mostly go away  but not entirely.  Beyond the flickering  I felt the camera simply took poor photos compared to other cameras I have had  even those with 1/4 to 1/2 the resolution of this one.  Pictures were prone to blurring  I would say this has the least effective optical image stabilization of any point-and-shoot I've owned.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RouO%2BYEgL._SX300_.jpg,Sony W800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black)

http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Camera-18-55mm-75-300mm/dp/B00V73JZY6,This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting.,http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Camera-18-55mm-75-300mm/product-reviews/B00V73JZY6, on March 19  2014,To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography. The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses.  These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations. And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also. Over the course of this review I get a mention some basics about digital photography that can help you if you're a first-time camera buyer. NOTE: You can get the older models like the T3i and save a few bucks but still get the full manual controls like this camera.   The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one. It has an articulating LCD screen and the LCD screen has more pixels I really recommend it over this camera and it's even cheaper. I put it on par even with the Canon T5i. so be sure to check it out I think the T3i is the camera to get at the present time. 1. The number one reason to get a camera like this is the full manual controls over such things as shutter speed and aperture. Most point-and-shoot digital cameras that you can buy today for under $200 don't allow you to adjust these things but really if you're serious about photography learning how shutter speed and aperture work together to create photographs is very important. And the fact that this camera allows you to control these features and so many more manually means you can make great photographs.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kGlATJzSL._SX300_.jpg,Canon EOS Rebel T5 Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm IS II + EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Bundle

http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Coolpix-L330-Digital-Camera/dp/B00HQDBLDO,Very good camera for its class,http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Coolpix-L330-Digital-Camera/product-reviews/B00HQDBLDO, on December 26  2014,"If you are looking for a snapshot camera that can pretty much do it all  this Nikon Coolpix L330 is worthy of your consideration.  I am a camera nut and own both full-size Nikon SLRs (my present one is the Nikon D5300) as well as small pocket cameras.  This L330 is essentially a hybrid between the two -- it is small (and light) enough to be easily carried  and yet has a large and powerful lens that can do many things better than a true pocket camera. The outstanding characteristic of this camera is the lens.  The lens features a much larger objective lens than any pocket camera  which means that it is capturing more light for more detail and sharper shots.  For taking still pictures  for example  I notice a clear difference in favor of this camera in comparison to my Canon pocket camera. The 26X optical zoom really makes this camera a ""do all"" for both landscape shots  portraits  and many other kinds of shooting.  Like all cameras of this class  this one is probably not the camera to use for action shots such as flying birds or football games  although it may do in a pinch. Ergonomically this camera is well thought-out.  I was able to pretty much completely figure this camera out without resorting to the manual  which is a good thing as the manual is nearly useless.  Most users should simply spend 20 minutes browsing through the camera menus; this will adequately familiarize most users with the camera. (The manual is very rudimentary.)  Frankly  you can put most settings on ""auto"" and do just fine with this camera.  The viewfinder shows both shutter speed and F/stop  which is a nice feature for more advanced shooters.  The flash is easy to use and is pretty good for a flash of this class.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nk4I%2BmeKL._SX300_.jpg,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black)

I got the camera today on-time and already took some test photos and checked this camera out and here is my initial review of the Nikon L840 digital camera. This camera replaced another Nikon  a P520 digital camera. I could not afford another P520 and decided to give this lower graded Nikon L840 digital camera a try. Good points so far I have noticed: 38X optical zoom  decent interior photo quality with no flash  decent outdoors photo with no flash. video quality seems fine and can do HD videos also. Various scene modes and exposure/brightness control this camera does have [despite Nikon saying this camera does not have exposure control  it does have it and can be done manually]  looks sharp [I got the red model] and fairly easy to use. Also uses 4 ""AA"" batteries which surprised me and takes the easy to find ""SD""  ""SDHC"" or ""SDXC"" cards. Tiltable rear viewfinder also handy. The bad points so far I have spotted includes: no optical viewfinder  no ""mode wheel"" on top of the camera.....you have to use the menu system on this camera. This camera also feels so ""plastic"" or cheap. I have a similar Canon SX520HS camera and it has a metal or stronger heavier plastic lens barrel on it....but this Nikon has a thinner plastic lens barrel and feels cheap...even tho the camera looks sharp. I had intentions of getting another Nikon P520 or even the P900....or a similar Canon digital camera.....",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M-oI42JJL._SX300_.jpg,Nikon COOLPIX L840 Digital Camera with 38x Optical Zoom and Built-In Wi-Fi (Black)

http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-DX-format-18-55mm-55-200mm-Lenses/dp/B00T8LQ8VW,The Best Possible Camera For 99.9% Of Us,http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-DX-format-18-55mm-55-200mm-Lenses/product-reviews/B00T8LQ8VW, on May 2  2014,I'm a full time photographer and an artist.  I've been doing this for almost 2 decades.  I've used a Nikon D90 for the past five years.  Before that  I used a Nikon D70 for five years.  As you can tell  I don't obsess over gear or gadgets.  I buy a new camera when my current one is failing or falling apart.  I want to spend my time making images  not shopping.  No camera takes great photographs or bad ones.  Artistry  craft  knowledge  and experience (not to mention luck) is what makes a great photograph  whether you're using a Leica or a shoe box with a pin hole.  If you don't understand this  than the rest of my brief review will make absolutely no sense to you  and you can go back to looking at charts and graphs on digital camera review sites. If you can't take amazing photographs with this camera  you can't take amazing photographs period.  Spending more money on a higher end camera is a waste of money for you. If you can take amazing photographs with this camera  than spending more money on a higher end camera is (most likely) a waste of money for you.  Spend the money you save on a good lens or a weekend trip to a place that would be interesting to shoot. What it comes down to is this: this camera has the best combination of image quality  features  handling  size/weight  and price on the market right now.  The kit lens is $250 when purchased separately.  That means you're paying $350 for the D3300 body.  That is an incredible deal. Going from a D90 to this camera  I gave up a couple of buttons/dials  but I don't miss them in the least.  The settings I change on a regular basis (aperture  shutter  exposure compensation  ISO  etc) can all be set just as quickly and easily on the D3300 as on the D90.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41G8D-4CF3L._SX300_.jpg,Nikon D3300 DX-format DSLR Kit w/ 18-55mm DX VR II & 55-200mm DX VR II Zoom Lenses and Case

Nikon D3300 is rated 30% higher in image quality compared to the Canon 70D. The Nikon D3300 has a slightly larger sensor than the Canon 70D. I was torn between Canon and Nikon. If you look at all the complaints about Canon in the last 1 or 2 years  you will see that they have been going backwards or sideways  while other companies are making huge strides. The Canon 70D is a smooth fast auto-focusing camera that is silent  however if you set it to auto mode and go take pictures they don't look as good as the Nikon D3300 on auto mode. Comparing pictures side by side with the Canon 70D  the Nikon D3300 has sharper pictures. Zooming in on the photos I took with the 70D yielded a loss of detail. At the same quality settings  same aperture  and shutter speed settings  and with the exact same scene  I am able to zoom in and get better photos from the Nikon D3300  the D3300 really captures crisp photos. The D3300 may be the only camera that doesn't have image quality problems with the 24 Megapixels. There is a megapixel war going on  although sensor sizes aren't increasing  which means the image quality isn't getting better with many cameras  because they are simply trying to cram more pixels with even less light per pixel  which doesn't help matters. However  the D3300 pulls off the impossible and gets beautiful very sharp photos every time.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41G8D-4CF3L._SX300_.jpg,Nikon D3300 DX-format DSLR Kit w/ 18-55mm DX VR II & 55-200mm DX VR II Zoom Lenses and Case

All of these cameras have great image quality  are reasonably small and light with intuitive controls.  Most of these Nikons improved with each new generation. The Nikon D3300 is smaller and lighter than its predecessors  the D3200 and D3100.  It is also considerably smaller and lighter than the D5200  the somewhat more advanced entry level Nikon DSLR.  The biggest physical change in this kit is the new ""VRii"" 18-55mm lens.  This new kit lens is smaller and lighter than its predecessor and 'collapses' into about 2/3 its size when not being used.  Perhaps more significantly  this lens is sharper capturing more detail than the older kit lens. The reduced size and weight of the D3300 appears to be Nikon's response to Canon's 100D/SL1.  Although the SL1 and D3300 are about the same size and weight  the D3300 has a better/larger grip and is more comfortable (to me anyway) than the SL1. Although the D3300 is the eventual replacement for the D3200  I purchased the D3300 in anticipation of replacing my D5200 assuming that this newer camera would have improved image quality over last year's models.  I was actually somewhat disappointed as I preferred the image quality of the older D5200.  That is not to say that the D3300 is not an excellent camera because actually it is. My testing was limited to still indoor shooting (it is already dark outside when I come home from work). I compared the D3300 to the D5200 shooting identical scenes using 3 different lenses under various lighting conditions. Both cameras delivered excellent high ISO results with similar ISO performance through ISO 3200 (I really do not like shooting past ISO 3200).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41G8D-4CF3L._SX300_.jpg,Nikon D3300 DX-format DSLR Kit w/ 18-55mm DX VR II & 55-200mm DX VR II Zoom Lenses and Case

This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past  you're not going to notice much of a change with this one  but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth  I'll briefly go over them: *** SCREEN *** The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white  but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons  please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit  off-white Kindle screen. I will say  the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new ""Carta"" displays instead of the previously used ""Pearl"" displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink  the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon  to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it! The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi  and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though  the base model PaperWhite runs $99 at the time of this review  and the Voyage base model runs $199 so you can see  the more you pay  the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a-Bydve5L._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle  6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"

Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us all? Do you have any clue what you bought? Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles  and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark? Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light  the Paperwhite and Voyage do. Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on ""BUY"" that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm  I belong to the latter bunch. Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is  are unable to sign on  and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a-Bydve5L._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle  6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"
http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Glare-Free-Touchscreen-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B00I15SB16,Good Value at $79 with a Few Nits,http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Glare-Free-Touchscreen-Display-Wi-Fi/product-reviews/B00I15SB16, on October 3  2014,I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective  considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today  this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child  maybe at $79 this is your price point. From a size standpoint  the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles.  It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite  but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover. Opening up the box  included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter.  That's really annoying. Interestingly  and it seems rather chicken of Amazon  a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for $15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or $20 if you purchase it later)  so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers. There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading  or swiping the screen with your finger. Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard  the previous version of Kindle  and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much  much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a-Bydve5L._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle  6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"

http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Stylus-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/dp/B00WNW7LR8,So much packed into such a small camera!,http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Stylus-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/product-reviews/B00WNW7LR8, on September 1  2013,"My husband wanted a small camera that he could use to take photos (as well as video) on a trip to Hawaii  some upcoming weddings  and to shoot reference photos for paintings that he would create at a later date.  He is notorious for not wanting to spend much money on something  and then later regretting that he chose something that didn't have enough of the features that he needed. On this occasion  I was happy that he didn't just go for the cheapest thing out there - he actually did a tremendous amount of online research and spent a little more than his normal budget  and he is THRILLED with this camera.  Part of his joy comes from that fact that this camera performs as well (and sometimes better) than cameras on which we have spent far more in the past (including a semi-pro digital video camera we spent over $1 000 for about 12 years ago). Granted  the video function has some drawbacks: the zoom is VERY harsh (not smooth/subtle at all)  and the sound drops out momentarily during the split second zoom.  However  that being said  the digital stabilization is VERY good  which is a big help in situations without a tripod.  (Obviously  the farther out you are zoomed  the shakier your shot will be no matter what you do.)  The zoom feature is surprisingly robust  with very good quality - great for nature shots  and at weddings where you are far away from your subjects.  My husband loved the fact that there is a grid feature for the viewer that allows you to keep a straight horizon line (for video and photos)  which has always been a struggle / pet peeve for him. The settings on this camera are helpful: he utilized the ""sunset"" setting very successfully in Hawaii and got shots that rivaled (and sometimes surpassed) those from my $1 000+ Canon20D digital.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PdvjDG7PL._SX300_.jpg,Olympus Stylus SZ-17 Digital Camera with 24x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD (Black)

Its not a compact pocket camera  and its not a super zoom (by current standards) bridge camera either. It is in between  a mid-size  if you will. This camera is an upgrade for my Olympus VG-180 (originally purchased for only $59 on Amazon which actually costs quite a bit more now)  which was my favorite compact among others i have had including a Canon powershot  Nikon Coolpix  and Kodak EasyShare. The reason I ended up with it is because I was looking for an ""upgrade""  but something smaller than my bridge camera for portability on walks and runs...but given that these nature runs are outdoors  i did not want to sacrifice a long zoom or 1080p video (both features lacking on my VG-180). Many of the less expensive compact cameras still have CCD sensors and are limited to 720p video. The more expensive ones have CMOS sensors and will allow for 1080p...and most of the less expensive compacts typically have a 5x to 12x zoom. At the time I am writing this review  I can say that there is just simply no better bang for the buck in a camera that I could find with these features. For $140.00 you get a camera with CMOS sensor that does 1080p video and has a 24x zoom...in a comparatively small form factor. Also you get the intuitive Olympus interface  and excellent outdoor performance  that I have long been a fan of after trying so many compact cameras.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PdvjDG7PL._SX300_.jpg,Olympus Stylus SZ-17 Digital Camera with 24x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD (Black)
http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/dp/B00JG8GOWU,More evolutionary than revolutionary  but worth the upgrade,http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/product-reviews/B00JG8GOWU, on September 30  2013,"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle  and when we buy a new Kindle  the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite  with its small size  touch screen  front-lighting  and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up  and for me  it was worth the move  but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot  and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles  it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite  the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours  I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite. SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7""x4.6""x0.36"". The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand  which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite  it will also fit the new one (thank you  Amazon). If you buy a case  I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch. LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite  which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me  but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite  where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting  you'll never need a clip-on light  even in total darkness.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519eBvJSgML._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle Paperwhite  6"" High-Resolution Display (212 ppi) with Built-in Light  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"
http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/dp/B00JG8GOWU,A new step forward for me in reading on my Kindle!,http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/product-reviews/B00JG8GOWU, on September 30  2013,I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark.  I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard.  I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money.  I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet.  It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text. I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them. I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear.  I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books.  Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it.  The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding.  With better contrast  lighting and custom designed fonts  the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519eBvJSgML._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle Paperwhite  6"" High-Resolution Display (212 ppi) with Built-in Light  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"
http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/dp/B00JG8GOWU,Good as a first Paperwhite  not worthy of an upgrade,http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display-Built/product-reviews/B00JG8GOWU, on September 30  2013,This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it  this is a great product. However  I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review  I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also  I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising  so I will try to clear them up. HARDWARE Design - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light  so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same  the buttons are in the same location  and although this version is slightly lighter  it is not noticeable. Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model  the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers  the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition  the lighting has been upgraded  so among other things  it is more evenly lit. Together  they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion  it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it  text look very sharp and crisp  with little to no eye strain. Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor  which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books  flip pages  and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also  the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519eBvJSgML._SY300_.jpg,"Kindle Paperwhite  6"" High-Resolution Display (212 ppi) with Built-in Light  Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers"

So far I am happy!,http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-FZ70-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/product-reviews/B00DY2Y28M, on September 4  2013,Update: 11/17/2014.  I have used the camera for several months now and love it.  I really like the zoom range of the camera from 20mm to 1200mm and it is my main daily carry camera.  It takes great detailed photos and the noise levels are very good. The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos  but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed. The camera works fantastically in iA  which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings. It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode  which is under the SCN mode on the main dial. The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera  you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter. The camera has no shutter remote cord jack  so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing  which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vVuEaWCJL._SX300_.jpg,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)

I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67  Pentax 6x7  Canon 5D Mk2  Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say  this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera  but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then  I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs. UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months  I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2  with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.

Update!,http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-FZ70-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/product-reviews/B00DY2Y28M, on September 9  2013,I've only had mine a few days so my testing is admittedly limited. Please do not give up on this camera unless you have made some very careful tripod shots. Yes  this camera is hard to hold steady as is any 300+ mm lens. The stabilizer is good but cannot overcome everything. Hand holding 1200mm is a tough job and requires excellent technique and a degree of luck! I used a heavy Bogen tripod on solid cement and made very careful shots at about 50yds and 75yds (auto focus) throughout the available f range at max zoom. I was quite surprised at the resolving power of the lens using ISO 100. My Nikon D5000 and Nikkor 70 - 300 EDIF zoom in RAW mode  on the same subject  is barely sharper. Laugh if you will  but I used the SilkyPix software to examine the RAW and jpeg images. I did not find a difference even worth mentioning in raw and jpeg modes. I did not use the default picture settings in the camera. SilkyPix works just fine if you take a bit of time to learn to use it. I also own PhotoShop and have used it for over 20 years  so it's not like I didn't have a choice. All images benefited from a bit of post processing just as all my D5000 and P7700 images do. I can see how some users might easily rush to judgement on this camera. But it shouldn't be about lens sharpness. Hold it steady and it will deliver very good results. Many of the review sites have not done a real good job of testing the camera yet. Buy it and make your own carefully controlled tests  then decide. Hand held tests at very high magnifications are totally INVALID for lens critiquing purposes. Few people can hold that long lens steady enough. High ISOs will certainly help keep shutter speeds high  but it's the high ISO NOISE then that will ruin the image sharpness ..,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vVuEaWCJL._SX300_.jpg,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)

The Power Saw: A great saw with the right balance between power and weight for most field jobs. My tests were done with the mid range battery pack  the 2 amp hr. The balance with this pack installed was a good fit for guiding the saw through the material. I tested it with few old first generation growth fir 2x4's with the stock blade. Next it was on to some plywood  3/4"" cabinet grade - about 10'. The stock blade tracked the guide line with out a lot of correction - I will probably switch out the blade for a cabinet grade 40 tooth version to reduce tear-out on higher quality woods. The safety lock and the blade brake make this a excellent saw for all around work. Lets face it  we all get tired and work past our point of safety (""The one last cut rule"") and having these features will probably save some fingers and thighs. It is a great complement to a 1800 watt electric saw  when there is no power around or you just don't want to dig out the extension cord. The Impact driver: Why do you need an impact driver? Think of it like putting all your muscle into just keeping the screw going into the wood - without it bouncing out and damaging the wall. The impact driver is like using a hammer and a screw driver at the same time - it pounds away at the screw while twisting it into position - all you have to do is keep the impact driver on the screw head. This is a tremendous assistance for working with long deck screws or driving them into hard woods.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHO4croSL._SY300_.jpg,DEWALT DCK421D2 20V MAX Lithium-Ion 4-Tool Combo Kit  2.0Ah

http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK421D2-Lithium-Ion-4-Tool-Combo/dp/B00NHBZ9AA,Great Tools - Value as a Packaged Set is Debatable,http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK421D2-Lithium-Ion-4-Tool-Combo/product-reviews/B00NHBZ9AA, on November 20  2014,This is a great set of tools. I already own several Dewalt power tools and have always been happy with their power  durability and longevity. They are definitely one of the good brands when benefit/value is a consideration. Over the last five weeks I have had a chance to work with all the tools in job situations and there is not a single one which didn't perform exactly as you expect it to. The circular saw is my favorite. This is the first time I've used a saw run from a battery and  of course  I had some concerns about power. With fresh  fully charged batteries (the kit comes with 2) this saw has more than enough power to rip through anything an average homeowner might need it for. It is nicely balanced and  without a power cord  incredibly versatile and easy to use. The saw rocks. The drill and the impact driver are good quality tools which like the saw seem to draw an incredible amount of power from the tiny batteries. These batteries are about the size of an old garage door opener and weigh around a pound each. They are easy to install  charge quickly and  depending on use  last an entirely appropriate amount of time. I'm not sure how much I will use the impact driver moving forward. It is an outstanding tool but it just seems like there could have been another tool which would have been more appropriate for the set. Maybe a jigsaw or a hand sander would have been more useful  at least for me. If you are using the impact driver then great  it works and like the other tools really has some power. If the flashlight/worklight was not part of the kit  I never would have even thought of purchasing this one. The design is awkward and when the battery is installed it is too heavy (for a flashlight).,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHO4croSL._SY300_.jpg,DEWALT DCK421D2 20V MAX Lithium-Ion 4-Tool Combo Kit  2.0Ah
http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK421D2-Lithium-Ion-4-Tool-Combo/dp/B00NHBZ9AA,A worthwhile set for everyday homeowner projects,http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK421D2-Lithium-Ion-4-Tool-Combo/product-reviews/B00NHBZ9AA, on October 10  2014,In my work I've always believed in using the right tool for the job to get the best results. As a homeowner the same holds true. It is almost impossible to have too many tools. I have owned several battery-operated drills from different manufacturers and have been generally not fully happy with any of them. In the past they added weight of the battery made them heavy and awkward and the old Ni-Cad cells allowed only a short amount of time before they had to be recharged  not to mention that the battery died after about a year (those tools used to have the battery built in  not batteries that snap on like these DeWalt tools. DeWalt is a very respectable brand name for tools and I had high hopes for this kit. In one bag it includes 3 of the most useful power tools  all using the same batteries. Although it is a kit this review will discuss each component separately. Note that while it is shown as a kit and referred to as a kit  in reality each item was pretty much just placed into a large cardboard box with a little packing paper stuffed in. It does not appear that this is really a kit but rather a collection of assorted DeWalt tools that also includes a carrying bag. Please see the video for a close-up view of each tool in the kit. THE DRILL After abandoning battery operated drills (except for my little Craftsman screwdriver/hole starter) I popped for a high-end Hitachi electric drill  which is near perfection in a drill. I love everything about it. What I don't love is that 8 times out of 10 I'm not immediately next to a power outlet which means dragging out the extension cord. That gets very old when I only have a couple of holes to drill. The DeWalt drill ranks high on the scale for quality of construction.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHO4croSL._SY300_.jpg,DEWALT DCK421D2 20V MAX Lithium-Ion 4-Tool Combo Kit  2.0Ah

The old Makita system just didn't have the balls to last long enough for professional use. How times have changed.... I'm a part time home improvement carpenter  and have had my Dewalt 20vMAX cordless for about a month. I purchased the ""Tool only"" version  and added 2 of the new 5amp hour batteries to go with it. I went with ""tool only"" based on some reading here that the tools included in many combo deals are not the same as buying the tool only  and I know for sure that is true with this saw. I have used this on a few framing jobs  and mostly on interior trim work  cutting lots of 1x pine moulding and 5/4 pine too. We did a job with all PVC Azack trim  and it cuts that stuff like butter. Just today  I had to rip 16' of 1x6  and this saw never even slowed down. At the end of the job  I checked the battery life and it still showed full.  This saw is nice and lightweight compared to a standard plug in 71/2"" saw. Obviously  it won't cut as deep  but it easily cuts through 2x4. I would guess you could crosscut 100 2x4 studs or more before needing to swap batteries. It easily cuts 3/4"" CDX plywood too. I find this saw very well balanced in my hand  and cutting a straight line is effortless. Working on a ladder is also much easier as it is lightweight compared to a full circular saw. Overall  I am very impressed with this  and it's now my go-to circular saw for most jobs. So much easier than stretching out a cord.

http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-Bare-Tool-DC390B-Cordless-Circular/dp/B002VWK5RI,An Average Circular Saw  Satisfactory For Home Owner Use,http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-Bare-Tool-DC390B-Cordless-Circular/product-reviews/B002VWK5RI, on November 21  2010,"At the current time  cordless saws have noticeably less power than corded tools.  The DeWalt DC390 is no exception to this.  It will certainly cut 2"" thick fir and pine lumber  but you won't get the same rate of production as with a corded saw. This saw has a thick base plate  which I like.  Thinner stamped metal base plates on circular saws often get bent after several years of use and the saws never work well after this happens. A routine use of the DeWalt DC390 will be to cut thin stock such as plywood.  It's handy to have a cordless tool for this purpose since you often have to extend your reach to make cuts.  However  this saw is poorly balanced for such work.  With the cut depth set shallow  the battery is raised high and the saw is top heavy.  If you put the saw down as you would a normal circular saw  it will tip over.  The lower half of the saw guard is made of a slightly flexible plastic.  Given this saw is likely to tip off worktables frequently  I think this is better than having a metal guard which might get permanently bent.  Plywood is often cut using a guide such as a bar of metal clamped to the work.  It is difficult to cut with the DeWalt DC390 while keeping it snug to a guide because  in addition to the trigger   the saw has a safety that must be pressed with your thumb.  It prevents you from wrapping your thumb around the handle  so you don't have a normal grip.  (The DC390 also suffers from a weakness of all direct drive circular saws in that the motor leaves little clearance under it and tends to bump into any clamps that you use to hold the guide.  It seems to me that manufacturers could do a better job of designing a motor housing that provided more clearance  even if only when the saw is set to do shallow cuts and motor is raised relatively high.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aaSO4SgDL._SY300_.jpg,DEWALT Bare-Tool DC390B  6-1/2-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Circular Saw

It's a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one). It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient  even when shooting video  since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera. Here is a brief list of the new camera pros & cons: PROS: * A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish. * A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body. * Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video. * Zoom Framing Assist - very useful new feature to compose your pictures at long telephoto. * Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills. * 5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies. * New 16MP high-resolution  high-speed CMOS Sensor. * The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm. * Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes. * Full HD 1920 x 1080  60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format. * Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded. * A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording  now on the top of the camera. * A new high-resolution 922K  3"" display. * WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet. * Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BXtbpzOaL._SY300_.jpg,Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera (Black)
http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX700-Digital-Camera/dp/B00I58M26Y,Very nice camera in many respects  but...,http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX700-Digital-Camera/product-reviews/B00I58M26Y, on April 15  2014,"First  a confession. I do own this camera  but purchased it elsewhere because it was available prior to Amazon's availability date. I won't repeat much of what's already been said  but hopefully amplify a little. There's much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom  quick and accurate focus  true HD video  relatively good build quality. I concur with the majority of the pros I've seen in other reviews  but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers: - TOKEN GRIP: While I'm sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors  it's still hardly a grip. I've come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist. In efforts to make the camera as small as possible  Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case. My old A650's grip is much better and  frankly  while it's physically larger  I don't find it unwieldy at all. - STIFF MODE SELECTION DIAL: Don't think for a minute that you can change the mode without getting a good grip on the camera first and using both your thumb and forefinger to rotate the dial. It's stiffer than all get-out  small  and feels plasticky compared to every other Canon I've owned  and I've owned several. - SUPER FINE RESOLUTION: Not available in Auto. What??!?! Not that going to Program mode in order to select it is the end of the world  but why  Canon  why? I see a significant difference in quality in many shots between the fine resolution provided in Auto mode and the Super Fine resolution that can be chosen in Program mode. - FLASH RECOVERY TIMES: Still a wait-and-see  but they were pretty long on first powering up the camera  occasionally 3 seconds of seeing ""Busy"" on the screen between shots.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BXtbpzOaL._SY300_.jpg,Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera (Black)
http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX700-Digital-Camera/dp/B00I58M26Y,Awesome 30X optical zoom  fast processing and lots of features,http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX700-Digital-Camera/product-reviews/B00I58M26Y, on April 10  2014,I was looking to replace my old Canon Powershot that's an ultracompact.  While the size made it super portable  I needed something with more zoom capability and a better lens for low light conditions.  I was willing to sacrifice some additional weight and size to get that.  Don't get me wrong--this is no high end DSLR camera.  I have a Nikon D90 for taking exceptional photos and that will be the camera I always go to for professional results.  I wanted something far more portable that did not require a camera bag when traveling  biking and hiking. I've had this camera for about a week now (purchased in Hong Kong while traveling).  I was introduced to this while looking for a Lumix  but since they were out of stock they introduced me to this one.  Since there were no reviews yet I tried a variety of shots within the store and was amazed how far the zoom worked and focus was very quick in situations.  Low light photos look really good so far  but I need to experiment more. The camera has a solid feel to it.  Definitely weighs more than my ultracompact  but I knew that going into this class of camera.  There are numerous features and the menu system can be a little daunting  but I tend not to get carried away with all of those special scene features.  Although the ability for the camera to take a picture based on the introduction of a face  a face smiling or winking is pretty slick.  LCD screen is beautiful and high resolution.  I've even linked it to my iPhone5 over Wi-Fi and like the ability to transfer pictures so that I can post some immediately on Flickr or Facebook. I have not taken many videos yet  but it looks nice so far.  I do like the ability of having a separate button for videos in addition to the normal shutter release.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BXtbpzOaL._SY300_.jpg,Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera (Black)
http://www.amazon.com/Husqvarna-128LDX-28cc-10-Inch-Detachable/dp/B0081X9PN6,Worth the price,http://www.amazon.com/Husqvarna-128LDX-28cc-10-Inch-Detachable/product-reviews/B0081X9PN6, on February 18  2013,Spent a lot of time researching pole saws. With three acres of tree filled property to work on  an electric pole saw (AC or Cordless) was out of the question. When I saw the relatively low price on this model I wasn't sure what to think  but I decided to take a chance since I've heard good things from friends who have used Husqvarna equipment. The shipping box arrived in perfect condition within the time frame that was promised. Once I got around to opening the box  I had the pole saw assembled within 10 minutes after reading the easy to follow instructions. After filling it gas and chain oil  I had no problem starting it. Off all the 2 cycle engines that I have used (Toro  Echo  Poulan)  this one was the easiest to start. One or two pulls and the engine started right up. I let it warm up for about ten minutes before trying to cut anything just like another reviewer recommended. After that  I was using this pole saw to cut through oak and mesquite branches without a problem. The saw easily cut through 6 inch diameter branches as long as I let the weight of saw and gravity do the work rather than force it through. I cut a few branches as big as eight inches in diameter  but I felt I was pushing the saw's cutting limit  since it did bog down a few times during those attempts. I didn't have too much trouble with oil consumption. I used this saw for an hour straight and the saw consumed about half the oil that was in the reservoir. I don't know if that is good or bad considering I've never owned a pole saw. I found the weight of the saw to be comparable to my gas powered weed trimmers. It does get tiring carrying this thing around over an extended period of use even with the included shoulder harness  but it is what it is.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31N9pnb520L._SX300_.jpg,Husqvarna 128LDX 28cc 10-Inch Detachable Pole Saw

I also looked on the Black & Decker site  and it didn't exist...only the battery.  However  I read the reviews for the 18v model...over 250 reviews...and I decided to take a chance and order it.  And I must say  I'm very happy with it.  I'm a 50 yr old lady with 2 neck fusions  and some strength issues due to them.  I also have many trees on my 1.5 acres that need what seems like constant pruning...previously by a manual pole saw...very hard for me. When it arrived  I was impressed with the ease of putting it together  and how light weight it is.  The included instructions are very detailed and easy to understand.  You can use it as 2 pieces or as 3.  2 pieces give you 6'  and 3 give you 9'.  It can reach 14' which includes 5' of your own height.  The battery charges in a couple hours from dead  and can be left on the charger after charging...indefinitely per the instructions. This eliminates the possibility of damaging the battery by forgetting it on the charger...unlike the 18v model which had several complaints about frying the battery if it's not removed when charged.  The battery is feather light...hard to believe it has the power it does.  I did purchase a 2nd battery from another site for $56 including shipping.  ...so my pruning wouldn't be cut short by a dead battery. As for using it...  It works very well  easily cutting through 1-2"" branches with no bogging down  etc.  Just let the saw's weight do the work.  I pruned for about 45 minutes the other day and didn't notice any drop in power...oak  palm fronds  etc.  I'm VERY happy with it and glad I ordered it.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21NRQvqQfiL._SX300_.jpg,Black and Decker LPP120B Bare Max Lithium Ion Pole Pruning Saw  20-Volt Without Battery

http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-LCS1020-Lithium-Chainsaw/dp/B00OC9WSDC,Amazing performance coupled with light weight!,http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-LCS1020-Lithium-Chainsaw/product-reviews/B00OC9WSDC, on December 15  2014,Last week  I hired a tree surgeon to cut down an elm tree (30 foot tall  16 inch trunk at base) close to the house in the front yard  leaving the material as it fell in order to save a couple of hundred bucks on the job by doing the haul off myself. Since my gas powered Stihl had been stolen earlier this year  and thus being chain saw poor at the moment  I decided to order the Black & Decker LCS1020 20V Max Lithium Ion Chainsaw  10-Inch for this job.  I had previously purchased a B&D 20V drill  and had been impressed with its performance using a 1.2 Amp Hour battery  and since I thought it would be nice to have a smaller chain saw on han for odd jobs  pruning  and such  I figured I couldn't go wrong with the purchase of the LCS1020. I am glad to say that I didn't go wrong with this purchase..........I wish I would have bought this a long time ago!!!  It took me about 5 1/2 hours to do the job outlined above  making what I would estimate to be around 100 cuts tota   and a total cutting time of about 30-40 minutes on q single full charge of the saw's 2.0 Amp Hour battery (supplied with the saw).  I almost finished the job in totalnwith just the one battery charge  but alas  it abandoned me at the end.  But then  I simply hooked up the other battery I had on hand (1.2 Amp Hour)  and used it for another 5 minutes of cutting time to finish off the job  with the smaller battery still have a lot of charge left to it.  Now  the largest size cuts that I was made were small  the biggest being 4-5 inches in diameter  I could tell that the LCS1020 would have been up to the task  but likely without as much battery life time. The light weight of the LCS1020 at 7.2 pounds definitely made the job easier; my other saw at twice the weight would have wore me out!,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eKftoS-1L._SY300_.jpg,Black & Decker LCS1020 20V Max Lithium Ion Chainsaw  10-Inch

I was happy to see that they make this battery powered chainsaw.  We have a gas chainsaw but like many others have noted  starting it takes more energy than using it.  I really needed something easier and faster to use.  We're mainly cutting Aspen and some pine for firewood. As soon as this came in the mail  I pulled out the battery and the charger and got it to cooking.  It took about 5 hours as the booklet said to reach a full charge.  During that time  I read through the instruction booklet and put the saw together.  That didn't take more than a few minutes and requires absolutely no tools.  I was impressed with the sturdiness of the saw.  The saw is made of metal and plastic and is very light and well-balanced. I'm not a big  strong lumberjack  I'm a great-grandmother   so I'm not all that keen on chainsaws but doing a job without the right tool is just wrong.  This is the right tool for me.  I was able to cut a nice pile of logs up in the 20 minutes of operating time for the battery charge.  I have a picture of my pile below. I like the weight and how easy it is to use the saw.  I don't like the manual lube of the chain.  It's annoying to have to push the little plunger after every cut or so to keep the chain lubed.  I like that I feel safe while using the saw.  It seems easy to keep it in control as it's not running anywhere near as fast as our gas chainsaw.  I also like how easy it is to adjust the tension on the chain if I see it getting a little loose.  I don't have to stop what I'm doing and pay attention to taking care of that. Bottom Line:  The price was right and I'm happy with my purchase.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eKftoS-1L._SY300_.jpg,Black & Decker LCS1020 20V Max Lithium Ion Chainsaw  10-Inch

http://www.amazon.com/Remington-RM1015P-Branch-10-Inch-Electric/dp/B00008ZOXX,Decent Product,http://www.amazon.com/Remington-RM1015P-Branch-10-Inch-Electric/product-reviews/B00008ZOXX, on September 7  2006,I have used a gas pole saw by Husqvarna in the past so I am familiar with these saws.  Overall this product is decent.  It doesn't cut as sweet as the Husqvarna but it gets the job done.  The older reviews in this sequence are for an outdated model that they no longer sell.  They fixed most of the problems that people reported below.  The latest saw has a hex shaped pole so you can identify it as the latest version.  I would recommend this saw  for light duty sawing only. Don't think that because this saw is electric with lots of plastic that it is light and easy to maneuver.  Extended fully out it takes some strength to use.  The Husqvarna is only 6 feet long and lighter  but 3 feet shorter than the longer reach of the Remington.  The Husqvarna also sells for 5 times more than the cost of the Remington which makes the Remington a bargain. What makes this saw clumsy to use is the motor location.  For example  the Husqvarna has the motor located below your hands.  The saw is driven by a gear internal to the pole.  That feature is also its limitation  in that the length is not adjustable.  With most of the weight positioned below your hands the saw is easy to manipulate.  But for the Remington  the motor is at the end of the pole.  That puts the balance point at the wrong end which makes it harder to maneuver when fully extended.  Set to 6 feet it's not bad.  Some of the battery operated pole saws put the weight at the bottom where it should be and could also be a consideration. My only real complaint about this saw is the oiler which didn't work well.  Since I'm experienced with chain saws I could see that the amount of oil feed on the chain after repeated pumping was still inadequate.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ulcz2r5KL._SY300_.jpg,Remington RM1015P Branch Wizard Plus 10-Inch 8 Amp 2-in-1 Electric Chain Saw/Pole Saw Combo

Some of the cheapest sellers have only 50-60% positive rating  while it is normal to see 90% positive. 1-MODE VS. 3-MODE: The cheapest sellers are typically offering the 1-mode light  so expect to pay a bit more for a 3-mode.

http://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Modes-Torch-Adjustable-Focus/dp/B00ZS1F5LA,Great little torch. Demo video for the Operation Modes,http://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Modes-Torch-Adjustable-Focus/product-reviews/B00ZS1F5LA, on August 28  2012,Hello all  Just a quick review and a bit of instruction that I've discovered to work on my 3 flashlights. For the money  I am very happy with this little gem of a light. It is small and it uses a commonly found battery. Run time may be suspect for some  but for infrequent to moderate use it's wonderful. For a small carry torch it does whatever you would need to do with it. I use it all the time to get through the dark parts of my basement or toolbox at night on the wide angle beam and for spotting the animals and neighborhood kids causing trouble in our yards with the focused beam. A lot of people have posted about issues they are having with their lights having either 'on/off mode' or 'high/low/strobe modes' using the switch on the back  but not both. I can say that all three of these torches I purchased have had all of these modes depending on how you use the button and the period in between 'on' or 'off' cycles. I discovered this by accident on my first flashlight which was lost in a motorcycle accident. I ordered two next time because I missed it so much. Of my entire ordeal from the accident the one thing I was most sore about was losing that little flashlight. When the next two arrived the first thing I did was cycle through all of the modes to make sure my last one wasn't a fluke. It wasn't. These two worked exactly the same way. It would have probably helped if the manufacturer had placed some type of instructions for this in the box  but none of mine arrived with anything but the bubble wrapped light inside a plain white box. I assume you all received the same.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z4EDAwpTL._SY300_.jpg,Mini Cree Led Flashlight 3 Modes Torch Adjustable Focus Zoom Light Lamp
http://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Modes-Torch-Adjustable-Focus/dp/B00ZS1F5LA,Bad Buy,http://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Modes-Torch-Adjustable-Focus/product-reviews/B00ZS1F5LA, on November 12  2012,Having noted all the positive reviews about these flashlights  I ordered two lights as well is the recommended battery and charger. I was happy to receive the lights much sooner than the five week estimated shipping time. Both of the lights I received were labeled Cree  Ultra fire  and I must say the case design is excellent  very strong  and a really nice design it even has a very nice clip on it which is very solid and should secure the light to your belt with no problems. I bought the lights to use while walking my dog and night  so I charged up the batteries and took my dog for a walk using one of my nice new lights  we were out for about 30 min. and I marveled at how bright the beam was and how easily adjustable it was. We were out for about a half an hour or so  I walked my dog second time that evening  and again the light performed very well  I was very impressed with it. I was so impressed that I gave one of the lights to my sister telling her how great it was  it was light and easy to handle when you're walking a dog at night and trying to keep up with his leash and the light. At this point I'd use my light a total of about an hour so the next night I took my dog out for a walk with my brand-new light  after about 10 min. my light just shut off pushing the on off switch did not produce any results. I thought this might be because the battery was dead  I changed the battery and I had light again but  after about 10 min. the lights shut off again  and unfortunately this happens every time I try to use the light now  with fresh batteries or any beam focus settings that I use. While my light just goes off with no warning the one I gave my sister will dim  and then shuts itself off after just a few minutes of operation.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z4EDAwpTL._SY300_.jpg,Mini Cree Led Flashlight 3 Modes Torch Adjustable Focus Zoom Light Lamp

http://www.amazon.com/iXCC-Tangle-Free-Tangle-Resistant-3-5mm-enabled-Smartphone/dp/B00KWR8Q9S,Works well for use with speakers  in vehicles and with gaming and music headsets,http://www.amazon.com/iXCC-Tangle-Free-Tangle-Resistant-3-5mm-enabled-Smartphone/product-reviews/B00KWR8Q9S, on August 6  2014,This 3.5mm auxiliary cable has been performing well with the several different situations I've used it in. The first being connecting my PS4 controller and my music headphones together. The PS4 controllers are designed with an auxiliary port built into it  so one can plug any kind of ear buds or headset into it  and be able to listen to the audio through the ear pieces instead of the TV. I have a large Turtle Beach headset I use with it at times (with a built in microphone)  however sometimes I just want to hear the audio and not also have a mic in my face. So instead I'll plug in one of my earphone headsets to the controller  that are meant for music and not chatting. The problem I run into is that these days the auxiliary cables that come with most sets of music headphones now all include a small mic built into the cable somewhere  so that people can answer their cell phone even with their headphones on. The mic then shows up on the PS4 online gaming lobbies  and people think you have a mic on and try and talk to you  even when it's turned off. The only way I've found to fix this is to replace the auxiliary cable that comes with my headphones with one like this iXCC one  that's made to be just the basic cable and void of any additional unwanted extras  like a built in microphone. This cable has been just what I needed to do this. It works great for using with a headset that you want to plug into a PS4 controller. The second thing we've been using this cable quite a bit for is with my husband's Android phone and our car. He likes to listen to music from apps like iHeartRadio on this phone  through the car's speakers. One of our last auxiliary cables again had a built in mic we didn't need.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BEHeoGbBL._SY300_.jpg,iXCC ® 6Ft Male to Male 3.5mm Universal Gold Plated Design Tangle-Free [Tangle-Resistant] Slim Thin Auxiliary Audio Stereo Cable Cord for [All 3.5mm-enabled devices] iPhone  iPad  iPod  Samsaung Galaxy  Samsung Note  HTC M9  Kindle  Android  Smartphone  Tablet and MP3 Player

http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/dp/B000W91XBO,Do You Really Need A Converter Like This?,http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/product-reviews/B000W91XBO, on February 15  2011,"- Having gone through part of the reviews here  I guess some users might have misunderstood the application of this converter. If you want to use your ELECTRONIC devices operated with a rechargeable battery (such as your iPhone  cell phone  ipod  ipad  laptop  digital camera) in a foreign country  you don't need to bother  because nearly all these electronic products are designed today to be completed with a battery charger suitable for a voltage range from 100V to 240V; in other words  people travel around with these electronic items  so these items should work properly at any voltage anywhere in the world. Whatever you have and wish to use in a foreign country  just carefully check the marking on the battery charger about the voltage rating ... if the voltage rating is printed or embossed as ""100-240V""  then don't worry  you can use your devices without such a converter. Another thing you should check is if you will need a plug adapter for that country  because there are quite many types of power plugs in the world. For example  if your laptop's battery charger has a U.S. type power plug  you cannot plug it directly into a wall socket in Australia or in the U.K.  since the pins and the slots do not match. I also brought with me two laptop's  a cell phone and an SRL digital camera from China (at 220/240V) and have been using them here in the U.S. (at 110V) for almost half a year ... everything is okay as perfectly as they worked in China  because the battery chargers can work at any voltage from 100V to 240V. In this case  I only bought a plug adapter  so that the 3-flat-pins plugs (Chinese standard plug) of these battery chargers could be inserted to the wall socket here in the U.S.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413ZUEmMMyL._SY300_.jpg,Simran 1875 Watts International Travel Voltage Converter For 110V USA Products In 220V/240V Countries.

http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/dp/B000W91XBO,Know the limitations of this Travel Voltage Converter and don't get burned,http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/product-reviews/B000W91XBO, on September 30  2013,"The Amazon description for this product ( ) says: ""Ideal for Hair Dryers  Phone  iPod  Camera Chargers and Shavers Etc."" But except for the hair dryer  most appliances listed don't even need to use a voltage converter overseas. Check with the hotel of your destination to see if your room is already equipped with a hair dryer. If that is the case  you'll have two less items to pack for your trip. This 'travel voltage converter' is actually two different converters built into one package. At `LO' setting (0-50W)  it uses a small AC transformer to convert 220V sinusoidal waveform into 110V sinusoidal waveform. This is the preferred approach which works well for any low-power electronic appliance. One obvious limitation is that the appliance's power consumption must be under 50W (most laptop computer's AC adapters are rated for 90W or higher  by the way). If you connect a higher-power appliance to this converter at LO setting  the transformer's iron core will become saturated. This results in runaway input current  which may then cause overheating. At `HI' setting (up to 1875 Watt)  the converter simply uses an electronic switch to 'chop' the 220V sinusoidal input voltage into smaller segments  such that the average power delivered to output load is reduced. This is the same principle used by most incandescent lamp dimmers. It works reasonably well for simple HEATING appliances  such as travel irons or hair dryers.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413ZUEmMMyL._SY300_.jpg,Simran 1875 Watts International Travel Voltage Converter For 110V USA Products In 220V/240V Countries.

http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/dp/B000W91XBO,You need to understand what you need the  converter to do,http://www.amazon.com/Simran-International-Converter-Countries-SM-1875/product-reviews/B000W91XBO, on June 15  2012,I think   The guy that said Do you really need a converter like this  is right on track. By even allowing this item to be listed and sold  in my opinion  Amazon is letting us  the consumer down. It is clear to me Amazon`s master is the seller.  And in my opinion this seller is marketing a product that can't possibly live up to the description. It would take magic. This device weighs 1 pound! Since the picture is poor and the supporting information is almost  non-existent  all you have is the description  plus your own intuition. Recognize this devices has two parts one for the power coming in (220V at about 9 amps)  and one for the power going out  120 V at about 18 amps. This about the same power a circuit from a breaker in a modern house  20A. I am puzzled by the people that say they used a hair dryer with the convertor. I casually looked at the 5 star ratings  most don't indicate the amount of power used by the hair dryer  or most of the other devices. We read theses reviews and  well  depending on how bad we want the device to be good  we will often disreguard the complainers and the bad reviews. We neeed to pay closer attention. I didn't see a positive review that gave specifics for power used. This would make a person think the 5 star reviews probably used  well a lot of the advertised power available  but who knows? But once you read Do you really need a converter like this   you can understand what the reviewers are using is small amounts of power. Calling this thing an adapter confuses  most people  it causes them to think of their cell phone charger or lap top charger. A big laptop charger is 200 watts. Most are smaller. 1800 watts is 9 times the power of a  laptop charger!,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413ZUEmMMyL._SY300_.jpg,Simran 1875 Watts International Travel Voltage Converter For 110V USA Products In 220V/240V Countries.

http://www.amazon.com/EZOPower-Certified-Lightning-Transmitter-Cigarette/dp/B00DRB6PNA,I love this thing,http://www.amazon.com/EZOPower-Certified-Lightning-Transmitter-Cigarette/product-reviews/B00DRB6PNA, on March 23  2014,"I don't know why I've never bought one of these before. It works perfectly for me and is just the greatest thing I could have asked for for playing my music or using GPS in the car. The actual transmitter is stronger than any other transmitter I've ever had  and I've had quite a few. I seriously rarely (as in once  ever) experienced any static  and the one time I did it was extremely minimal and I was in the shadow of a large building with a large cover over my vehicle and it cleared up immediately upon moving. I have never had to change the channel once I found a marginally empty one  which is actually pretty difficult out where I live  so it's nice to have such a strong signal. The power is provided by a USB port and you can actually use any USB cable to power anything but it does come with a lightning connector cable. I did have an issue with the cable they sent. The cable is a separate item in an entirely separate box from a totally different manufacturer. The cable they originally sent with the transmitter stopped working after a few days and would not work for any purpose on any device or in my home or anything. I was quickly sent a replacement and I haven't had a problem with it since. The connection to the 12v port in your car is pretty tight  but for good reason. When you add your phone's weight hanging 6-8"" in the air  you need the power port to hold the whole thing up without falling out. In my car the port holds it just fine with no problem but my wife's car won't hold the weight. So I guess if you have a weak port or a loose one  this might be a problem for you. The clamp fits my phone without a case perfectly. It also fits with a Lifeproof case on and an Otterbox Armor case. Obviously the bigger the case  the tighter the fit.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eLcwJTJaL._SY300_.jpg,EZOPower Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / 5 / 5S / 5C  iPod Touch 5 with LED FM Transmitter Car Cigarette Socket Mount Holder Handsfree Car Kit

http://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-RSW18100-Gauge-Quality-Speaker/dp/B000K8MV86,Total FRAUD - DO NOT BUY!,http://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-RSW18100-Gauge-Quality-Speaker/product-reviews/B000K8MV86, on August 21  2010,"Please  to avoid frustration by not receiving what is shown and what you will pay for  PASS on this and find something else. I received this ""14 gauge"" wire today  and it is not even close. According to AWG (American Wire Gauge) charts  14 ga stranded wire has a diameter of .073 inches or 1.8542 mm. I used digital calipers to measure this purple/fucia color wire which I received  and the wire measured out at .043 inches  which is LESS than 18 gauge wire. 18 gauge wire has a diameter of .048 inches. So this garbage is not even 18 gauge  rather somewhere around 19 gauge  A good 14 gauge wire should be made of somewhere in the area of 45 - 50 30 gauge strands   and a best would be in the area of 100 to 110 strands of 34 gauge wire. Why you may ask is that important? Well wire carries the electrons on the ""skin"" or the ""outside"" area of it. SO - more strands equals more surface area which means better flow of the electrons (signal) the amp is putting out to the speakers. The smaller the gauge number  the more ampacity it has (abillty to carry/pass) the electron flow from point a to point b ( amp to speaker). This company should be ashamed of itself for passing of say 18 gauge wire for 14 gauge wire. I was so upset with this sort of practice and my findings  that I did not evem desire to measure the total length on the spool to check if it was 100 ft. or not. My instinct says probably not. AMAZON should immediately remove this from sale. It is against the law to sell product like this. Many buy as I did for price point  based on representation  and do not have the technical knowledge to even know they have beed ripped off.

I have always preferred a memory card from SanDisk because I have had good experiences with the customer support.  This card is newest version and claims 48MB/sec speed.  So  according to the specification  the new version should be more than 50% faster than the old one.  And below is my CrystalDiskMark results for both 64gb SDXC cards.  I ran the tests on my ASUS notebook (i7-4500U 1.8 Ghz  8GB memory  Windows 8.1 build 9600). * The NEW Version   Sequential Read :  32.750 MB/s   Sequential Write :  13.849 MB/s   Random Read 512KB :  31.239 MB/s   Random Write 512KB :  0.748 MB/s   Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.414 MB/s [  833.5 IOPS]   Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.936 MB/s [  228.5 IOPS]   Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  2.906 MB/s [  709.4 IOPS]   Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  0.943 MB/s [  230.2 IOPS] * The OLD version   Sequential Read :  33.964 MB/s   Sequential Write :  10.144 MB/s   Random Read 512KB :  31.177 MB/s   Random Write 512KB :  4.762 MB/s   Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.467 MB/s [  846.4 IOPS]   Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.921 MB/s [  224.8 IOPS]   Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  2.958 MB/s [  722.2 IOPS]   Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  0.481 MB/s [  117.5 IOPS] As you see from the above results  the new version showed almost same performance as the old version.  Only 'Sequential Write' is 30% faster and rest of the results were rather disappointing.  When I actually copied a file size of 1GB from and to both memory cards  I did not feel much speed improvement.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41330J9KhmL._SY300_.jpg,SanDisk Ultra 64GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDXC Memory Card Up to 48MB/s With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-064G-G4A [Newest Version]

http://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Ballistics-Touch-screen-Ultra-clear-Protection/dp/B00QN1T6NM,Excellent screen protector for my new iPhone 6,http://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Ballistics-Touch-screen-Ultra-clear-Protection/product-reviews/B00QN1T6NM, on January 29  2015, I just got this Maxboost screen protector for my iPhone 6. I'm a bit on the clumsy side and I have a tendency to put my phone in dangerous situations so I'm always on the lookout for solid screen protectors  even more so now that I have the iPhone 6. This screen protector is a really nice tempered glass material  not plastic and flimsy like many other screen protectors I have tried  and I really feel like it does an exceptional job of protecting my screen. The screen protector comes packed with a number of features including finger print resistant  oil repellant  ultrathin  and it has a hydro-phobic coating. It also comes with a little installation kit consisting of an alcohol swab  a micro fiber cloth  dust absorber  and some guide stickers (I'll get to those later). To install: 1. Start  by using the alcohol pad to clean your phones screen. Make sure you clean it well  any little trapped pieces of dust can create unsightly air bubbles later. 2. Use the Micro Fiber cloth and dry the screen as thoroughly as possible. 3. Next use the dust absorber and blot across the screen to pick up any last traces of dust left behind. 4. Lay the screen protector face down (the removable film should be facing down) on the phone screen. Adjust the position until you have it just the way you like it. 5. Take the guide stickers and press them over the edge of the phone. This will help hold the screen protector in place. You can use all three if you want  but I usually just use two. 6. Now flip the screen over so the removable film is facing up and peel off the film. 7. With the sticky side revealed  flip the screen protector back over and carefully place it into position. The guide strips should be doing most of the work for you. 8.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wxjlaS0qL._SY300_.jpg,"iPhone 6 Screen Protector  Maxboost® iPhone 6 Glass Screen Protector (4.7"")- [Tempered Glass] World’s Thinnest Ballistics Glass  99% Touch-screen Accurate  Round Edge [0.2mm] Ultra-clear Glass Screen Protector Perfect Fit for iPhone 6 (4.7 inch ONLY) Maximum Screen Protection from Bumps  Drops  Scrapes  and Marks (Lifetime No-Hassle Warranty)"

http://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Ballistics-Touch-screen-Ultra-clear-Protection/dp/B00QN1T6NM,Finally  my search is over,http://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Ballistics-Touch-screen-Ultra-clear-Protection/product-reviews/B00QN1T6NM, on October 11  2014,Update 11/3/2014: I purchased a glass screen protector for my iPhone ( ) and realized that it doesn't play nice with the MaxBoost case. The combination of the MaxBoost case's form fitting design and the ScreenMate Screen Protector's reach to the edge of the phone's screen  causes the screen protector to be pushed up and bullied out of the way. Ultimately  I had to remove the MaxBoost case and replaced it with another that didn't cause a power struggle over screen space. ---- It's not often that I'm thoroughly impressed by a phone case. For the most part they're all relatively the same. Though this Maxboost case doesn't redefine the clear phone case  it does exude a sense of quality and endurance I did not feel from the other 5 clear cases I had purchased and tried on my iPhone 6. Those cases included brands like Spigen  TechArmor  Ringke and Belkin. Each of them had their pros and cons  ultimately I kept the Ringke Slim on my phone but continued my search for the perfect case. I received the Maxboost Crystal Cushion case today (earlier than expected) and when I took it out of its packaging and held it in my hand  I was immediately surprised by the rigidity and quality of the case. Mind you  I had never heard of Maxboost before  and for the price (as well as my disappointment with cases as of late) my expectations weren't too high. I popped off my existing case and slipped my phone into its new home and tested my phone's new look and feel.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wxjlaS0qL._SY300_.jpg,"iPhone 6 Screen Protector  Maxboost® iPhone 6 Glass Screen Protector (4.7"")- [Tempered Glass] World’s Thinnest Ballistics Glass  99% Touch-screen Accurate  Round Edge [0.2mm] Ultra-clear Glass Screen Protector Perfect Fit for iPhone 6 (4.7 inch ONLY) Maximum Screen Protection from Bumps  Drops  Scrapes  and Marks (Lifetime No-Hassle Warranty)"

I added the note that not all cases are actually Maxboost Crystal Cushion (below) and that people were ordering non-Maxboost cases believing that they were Maxboost cases.  Almost immediately  about 1/3rd of the votes suddenly stated that the review was not helpful.  All of this is an extremely short period of time and it felt as if it was some form of effort to bury my review.  In fact  my top reviewer ranking quickly dropped by roughly 100 points.  This smells of monkey business to me  but I can't prove a thing and will let you draw your own conclusions. New note:  I noticed that Amazon is lumping a ton of cases together with various designs as if they are all variations of the Maxboost Crystal Cushion case.  Please be aware that this is not the case.  I believe that only the first case  which will read Maxboost Crystal Cushion case is in fact a Maxboost case  as of this writing.  The rest are different ""fashion cases"".  While they could be okay  they probably shouldn't be added in with the Maxboost case and I'd probably trust them less than the Maxboost Crystal Cushion case.  Now  onto the review... I had originally purchased a Spigen Tough Armor case for my new iPhone 6.  The Spigen case was built tough.  I read a number of reviews that stated that there wasn't enough of a lip or rim on the front of the case to protect it and after using the case  I definitely disagree with that.  If I was to drop my phone from any sort of height  there's not much doubt in my mind that Spigen would likely provide solid protection.  In fact  I did drop the phone with the Spigen case on and the side of it hit a thin piece of a metal chair edge on.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wxjlaS0qL._SY300_.jpg,"iPhone 6 Screen Protector  Maxboost® iPhone 6 Glass Screen Protector (4.7"")- [Tempered Glass] World’s Thinnest Ballistics Glass  99% Touch-screen Accurate  Round Edge [0.2mm] Ultra-clear Glass Screen Protector Perfect Fit for iPhone 6 (4.7 inch ONLY) Maximum Screen Protection from Bumps  Drops  Scrapes  and Marks (Lifetime No-Hassle Warranty)"

This might help?,http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MGKL2LL-Wi-Fi-NEWEST-VERSION/product-reviews/B00OTWPS52, on November 1  2014,"It's hard to believe that Apple could improve upon the iPad Air  but they managed it with this device  the ""iPad Air 2"" launched in October 2014.  It's even thinner and lighter than the astonishingly slim predecessor.  It has the same remarkable all day battery life  but an even faster processor  anti-glare screen  and (my personal favourite)  the ""Touch ID"" fingerprint reader which means I can avoid using passwords and pin numbers. I've owned several iPads (starting in 2010)  and they are  without doubt  ""a thing of beauty"". A word of warning  this is a very long review and describes the entire iPad range to help you decide the best model for you.  It's broken up into sections to make it manageable  so make a coffee  sit down and read on. FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions ========================== Q: Is this covered by Warranty ? A: Yes.  Full 12 month Apple warranty  and 90 days free technical support.  You can also extend the warranty with ""AppleCare+"" for $100 a year provided to take out the cover within 60 days of buying your iPad.  This includes accidental damage insurance (up to two incidents per year subject to a $49 excess). Q: Why are these cheaper on Amazon than at the Apple store?  What's the catch? A: No catch.  You can buy in person from the Apple store (including free engraving)  or from your local tech store.  Alternatively buy from Amazon with a 30 day NO QUESTIONS ASKED return policy.  If you find this item is NOT as described  (eg. is not the right model)  return it immediately  report the issue to Amazon  and write a critical review. Q: Should I buy the Cellular option?

http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MGKL2LL-Wi-Fi-NEWEST-VERSION/dp/B00OTWPS52,Ultra-fast  great screen and it tested 56% more powerful than my iPad Air!,http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MGKL2LL-Wi-Fi-NEWEST-VERSION/product-reviews/B00OTWPS52, on November 4  2014,We own 4 generations of the Apple iPad devices.  They are the iPad 2  the iPad3  the iPad Air and the iPad Air 2.  We each use the tablets about 8 hours per day for photography editing  video taking and editing and working on the internet.  I am extremely familiar with the products and we own a total of 16 tablets using Apple  HP and Android technologies. In my attached video I have tried to do a comparison between several of the product generations and the overall performance.  Physically the iPad Air 2 is about the same  appearance wise  to the iPad Air.  If you look closely you will see some differences. * The iPad Air 2 is 18% thinner and a little lighter in weight. * The Retina display is better as it is thinner and the colors and clarity is much better to my eyes.  The parallax side views are clearer and the colors are deeper and more realistic.  It still has 264 pixels per inch and it is an excellent video device. * The iPad Air 2 has the newer finger print sensor on the home button. * The rear facing camera is in a different location on the back of the tablet and so your iPad Air cases will not work as they will interfere with your taking photos. * The microphone ports on the tablet have moved and I show the new locations in my video. * The portal holes for the stereo speakers are just one row now and larger and the speakers are louder sounding.  Not a major difference but it is noticeable. * The slide switch on the side of the tablet for the mute/screen lock rotate is gone now.  You have to make those adjustments in the operating system of the tablet now or use the sound volume switches. The major differences in the tablet are the ones regarding performance.  The CPU and GPU in the iPad Air are just very powerful.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ap2B-agbL._SY300_.jpg,Apple iPad Air 2 MGKL2LL/A (64GB  Wi-Fi  Space Gray) NEWEST VERSION

I found this case that was similar in design but a bit more stylish and a lot cheaper.  Actually I was a little worried about it being so cheap on Amazon  but the reviews were good so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about.  Case seems to function just as well as Apples and it actually seems a bit sturdier.  It's made from synthetic materials instead of leather like the Apple case  but I like it even better.  Seems like it would be easier to clean (especially handy for when my kids get their hands on it) and just feels easier to grip for me.  At least that's my opinion.  You should check it out. http://www.amazon.com/iPad-Air-Case-Landscape-Generation/dp/B00OKUBFNC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415224806&sr=1-1&keywords=roocase+optigon+air+2 Though it's only been a week since my initial review  I've been taking the iPad Air 2 to test out its capabilities further  much to the dismay of my family.  But as I mentioned earlier  I do have a windows tablet (8"" version) that I had been using as a supplement to my work computer.  I sometimes need to view spreadsheets  powerpoints or word docs away from the office and if it's just to check something or make a minor edit  it can be a major pain to pull out my full  work issued laptop.  I thought having full windows in a portable  as-needed  format was convenient.  But since I've been reading that the iPad is more productivity oriented in its present form  I had to see how it compared.  Especially since  I would have the convenience of the other tablet strengths of the iPad to boot.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ap2B-agbL._SY300_.jpg,Apple iPad Air 2 MGKL2LL/A (64GB  Wi-Fi  Space Gray) NEWEST VERSION

Style-wise I prefer the other covers they have (the ones with the snaps) but this is easy to use and functional. That black stripe across the front is an industrial strength elastic band. Seriously; I think you could bungee with it (""kids: don't try this at home""). It is sewn into the seams  in between the two layers of thick felt (the felt is about as thick as two or three quarters stacked on top of each other). At first I was tempted to put my laptop in this and toss it around like the Gorilla in that old luggage commercial  but then I realized that I was testing the cover  not the ability for my Macbook to be dropped from great heights. So  what's the verdict? Well  it is stylish  if you are into the whole grey wool suit look  or you live in a dry climate. It says it is mold proof  but it is not really waterproof. Still  among other sleeves I have seen  this one is nice--and it is different. It is not the same old laptop case everyone else at the party has  and when you get tired from too much work you can roll it up into a nice pillow. Structurally this thing is insane. I tried to pull it apart  but it just laughed at me. The pockets are exactly as they look in the product shots — ""minimalistic"" is the operative word here. I think my favorite part is that the inner sleeve is lined with a fabric that feels like ultra suede but is as thin as denim shirt. If you use this as a pillow  be sure to turn it inside out first for a pleasant nap. The lining is made of several layers  and they are all machine-stitched together with meticulous precision (well  it is a German company).

http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MGX72LL-13-3-Inch-Display/dp/B0096VDM8G,Just totally and utterly beautiful,http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MGX72LL-13-3-Inch-Display/product-reviews/B0096VDM8G, on August 15  2014,I'm coming to this Macbook Pro 13inch Retina laptop from a 2010 model Macbook Air that I absolutely adored for nearly 4 years. The Air was so light and portable that I reluctantly gave it up  but concerns of weight vanished once I got my hands on this beauty. Yes  it's slightly heavier  but only slightly. What I like most of all is how the body isn't tapered from back to front like the Air. It's a solid piece of symmetrical aluminum  and it just feels so well built. One of the reasons I eventually gave up and sold my Air in favor of this was the Retina screen. I've never seen one on the Macbooks  so I bought this sight unseen  but I had a vague idea of how it might look because I also own a retina iPad Mini and that screen is lovely. The screen on the mini is out-done by the amazing screen on this Macbook. I can't believe how good it is. And what's more  this Macbook only cost 100 dollars more than the latest Air. Why would anyone not pay the difference for this screen?  It's totally night and day between the Air's screen and this one. The Air is by no means terrible  but it cant compete with this. The audio is also a nice surprise on the Macbook with Retina. It was good on my Air  but it's far better on the Retina. There's no speaker grills either  so I assume they're below the keyboard. Regardless they sound amazing  albeit low on bass. My Air didnt have a backlit keyboard  so this was a nice surprise. No more hunting and hoping at night in bed. Another nice addition I didnt have before was HDMI-out. Now I can simply connect my Macbook to my HDTV and play Hulu on my TV. No reason to pay for Hulu Plus. On my other computer it wouldnt allow Hulu to output to TV  but its not being blocked on the Macbook for some reason.

A lot is different about this beast than the 2008 standard Macbook. A heavy plastic body that housed a removable battery  hard drive  ram and an optical drive is replaced with an aluminum unibody design where nothing is intended to be removable. In order to deliver a thin machine with a long lasting battery  Apple also removed the optical drive. In 2008 this would have been crazy  but in 2014 it's a generally accepted drawback. Clearly this new Macbook is a sign of a new generation of technology intended to be maintained solely by the company that sells the product. Apple wants to be your one stop shop from the point of sale to the day you retire the machine. It makes sense  since we do that with phones and tablets.

http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MGX72LL-13-3-Inch-Display/dp/B0096VDM8G,I haven't been drinking the Apple Kool-Aid  I swear; this is a legitimately great laptop,http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MGX72LL-13-3-Inch-Display/product-reviews/B0096VDM8G, on August 22  2014,"I've never really understood those in the PC camp who sneer at Mac users for being ""sheep"" - and having gone to a techie school for college  I've met more than my fair share. I've used both PC's and Macs throughout the years  and although I prefer certain aspects of the PC over its Mac counterpart  I've been swayed by the relative stability of the Mac's OS X operating system over Windows. Plus  once Boot Camp (a program that lets you install Windows on your Mac) came out  I was able to get the best of both worlds in one computer; I've stuck with Macs ever since. Although my 2012 Macbook Air was no slouch  my new 2014 Macbook Pro ups the ante in many respects. Although there's certainly been a performance boost - everything runs buttery smooth  and the SSD is blazing fast - the retina screen has been the selling point for me. When I first used the Pro  even the desktop icons were so clear the my eyes had a difficult time focusing at first  if that makes any sense at all. My eyes are now thanking me for purchasing this computer  and I would have a hard time going back to displays that are not at least close to retina level. While considering what kind of computer to buy  I almost went with the 2014 Macbook Air over the Pro. I knew that I wanted a relatively portable machine future-proofed with 8GB of RAM and a 256 SSD. But when the Pro came out a few weeks back  I noticed that Apple (finally!) upped the standard memory to 8GB for the same price as last year's model. The Air's standard memory is still stuck at 4GB  so I would have had to pay to upgrade to 8GB. That  coupled with the discounted price Amazon was selling it for  convinced me to go for the only slightly more expensive Pro; the price difference between the Pro and Air was only $80 at the time of purchase.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410WBREF71L._SX300_.jpg,Apple MacBook Pro MGX72LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop with Retina Display (OLD VERSION)

http://www.amazon.com/H2O-Nano-SIM-Card-Starter/dp/B00FPTSI9Q,If anyone is doubting whether to go to H2O  it's the best choice I have made!,http://www.amazon.com/H2O-Nano-SIM-Card-Starter/product-reviews/B00FPTSI9Q, on June 10  2014,I have owned Iphones and androids. I have used Verizon  AT&T  T-MOBILE  and Sprint. None of which have i felt where particularly great values. I started researching companies out there that offer cheaper prices and better values such as H2O  Smart Talk  PCS Metro  ect. I was absolutely shocked at the values to be found out there. The only catch with these companies is you have to provide your own phone  and have a phone that is compatible with each systems. HINT: H2O is compatible with mostly AT&T phones  so it is most likely a conglomerate of said company. Well I went on craigslist  and found a brand new iphone 5 with AT&T for a couple hundred bucks  and got this kit to sync it with H2O. I went with H2O because it had a plan of unlimited voice/text and 2 gb data for $40 + NO TAX!! That's right $40 flat! It also came with unlimited int'l text  and some int'l talk time as well. How awesome!! I did a little google research to find out how to exactly set up my phone to use imessage  and picture messaging  but after a little trial and error and about 20 minutes I got everything working! The 4G is faster that any 4G I've had before  and I have not had a single dropped call since I've started using this service. I could never get service in the big brick building at school  but this almost always gets full bars inside buildings! I don't know why  but this service just works great for me!! CONS: -You have to provide the phone. I do not think this is a con  because people waste sooooo much money agreeing to contracts that are so expensive just to not buy a phone that you can get for fairly cheap in comparison. My contract is so much cheaper I actually was able to make up the cost of my phone in about 4 months.

http://www.amazon.com/BLU-Advance-Unlocked-Phone-Black/dp/B00GXHPN1U,Would be perfect except for the screen,http://www.amazon.com/BLU-Advance-Unlocked-Phone-Black/product-reviews/B00GXHPN1U, on January 31  2014,"To introduce myself  I had a Samsung Skyrocket S2 that decided to die on me at the end of last month  and then my backup phone (a cheap Chinese phone) decided to start dying too.  There's a phone I want to spend some money on coming out in the next few months  but I need something to get by and to act as a backup phone when I do make that purchase  so after some searching I settled for this one.  I listen to a lot of music on my phone  read email  do some app development of my own as a grad student  and occasionally watch videos on Youtube or use GPS to find some place I've never visited before.  All in all  barring development I'm a fairly gentle phone user but I also have some tech savvy to form a useful opinion.  When I looked up info on the Advance 4.0  I was able to find specs but not much in the way of useful reviews  so I tried to be as thorough writing this as possible. Design: The Advance 4.0 is bulky for a 4"" phone - it's nearly as large in length and width as my 4.5"" Samsung S2 Skyrocket  and it's thicker too.  The outside of the case is smooth plastic - it isn't slippery in the hand but it does attract fingerprints more than any other phone I've had.  However  the phone does come with an Otterbox-like case and a screen protector  and I'd recommend using both.  Inside under the battery are two SIM slots and an SD slot.  The SIM slots are easy to use and well-labelled but the SD slot frankly scares me.  It's flimsy and easy to bend and doesn't offer much protection to the card in the slot.  Add that to being under the battery and this isn't a phone for someone who likes to use multiple SD cards.  However  all of this is to be expected with a phone in this price range  and getting a case and screen protector included is a great deal.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Nh3X8x3iL._SY300_.jpg,BLU Advance 4.0 Unlocked Dual SIM Phone (Black)
http://www.amazon.com/BLU-Advance-Unlocked-Phone-Black/dp/B00GXHPN1U,Hard to complain at that price...,http://www.amazon.com/BLU-Advance-Unlocked-Phone-Black/product-reviews/B00GXHPN1U, on April 18  2014,"I bought this phone to upgrade from my AT&T GoPhone Avail (ZTE-Z990). I didn't actually have much of a problem with the Z990  except for one thing: it only had 130MB usable space for installing apps. Even 4 years ago (when I originally bought it) that was considered a minuscule amount of space. After doing everything I could to get around this problem  I finally gave up and decided to find a new phone. The BLU Advance 4.0 has 1.27GB of space for apps (the other 2.72GB is for the Android OS). I know that's still pretty small by today's cell phone standards but it's a HUGE upgrade to me. I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be able to download and install all the apps I want  plus some I never had the option of installing before. (I still use AppMgr Pro III. It lets me know what programs I can move to my external SD card. Out of the 26 apps I've installed  11 were able to be moved to my SD card. At 37 apps I've only filled half the 1.27GB with the help of AppMgr.) I switched to T-mobile (from AT&T) with this phone. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to touch any settings to get this phone to work with T-mobile. Call  text  and data all loaded automatically when I installed the SIM card. I'm told HSPA+ is 4G. If that's the case then this phone DOES get 4G (as well as 3G and 2G). Reception for cell and data are  of course  entirely dictated by location. I've been very fortunate thus far  all things considered (I live in Wyoming  lol). I was pleasantly surprised to see there was absolutely no ""bloatware"" on this phone. I LOVE IT. There's something immensely satisfying knowing that not one bit of memory is being wasted on an app I don't want. Other than standard Google stuff (which is part and parcel with Android)  you only get the basics.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Nh3X8x3iL._SY300_.jpg,BLU Advance 4.0 Unlocked Dual SIM Phone (Black)

I've used both PC's and Macs throughout the years  and although I prefer certain aspects of the PC over its Mac counterpart  I've been swayed by the relative stability of the Mac's OS X operating system over Windows. Plus  once Boot Camp (a program that lets you install Windows on your Mac) came out  I was able to get the best of both worlds in one computer; I've stuck with Macs ever since. Although my 2012 Macbook Air was no slouch  my new 2014 Macbook Pro ups the ante in many respects. Although there's certainly been a performance boost - everything runs buttery smooth  and the SSD is blazing fast - the retina screen has been the selling point for me. When I first used the Pro  even the desktop icons were so clear the my eyes had a difficult time focusing at first  if that makes any sense at all. My eyes are now thanking me for purchasing this computer  and I would have a hard time going back to displays that are not at least close to retina level. While considering what kind of computer to buy  I almost went with the 2014 Macbook Air over the Pro. I knew that I wanted a relatively portable machine future-proofed with 8GB of RAM and a 256 SSD. But when the Pro came out a few weeks back  I noticed that Apple (finally!) upped the standard memory to 8GB for the same price as last year's model. The Air's standard memory is still stuck at 4GB  so I would have had to pay to upgrade to 8GB. That  coupled with the discounted price Amazon was selling it for  convinced me to go for the only slightly more expensive Pro; the price difference between the Pro and Air was only $80 at the time of purchase.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410WBREF71L._SX300_.jpg,Apple MacBook Pro MGX82LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop with Retina Display (OLD VERSION)
http://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Cutter-Standard-iPhone-Adapters/dp/B009P16FKY,The Right Tool for the Job,http://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Cutter-Standard-iPhone-Adapters/product-reviews/B009P16FKY, on October 21  2013,"In case you don't know  here's how this works.  GSM phones (like AT&T  T-Mobile  and most overseas carriers) use a ""SIM"" card.  For a while  SIM cards came in one size  and that fit any phone.  However  as phones started to get more and more sophisticated and manufacturers scrambled to fit more inside the device  the SIM card was targeted for size reduction.  First came the Micro-SIM  which is still popular and in use today in many devices (such as the Samsung Galaxy S4).  Then came the Nano-SIM  which is even smaller  and is used in the GSM version of the Apple iPhone 5  5C  and 5S. But here's the trick... aside from the size of the SIM  all three SIM cards are exactly the same.  In other words  you can take a big SIM and cut it down into a micro or nano SIM size.  The chip in the middle of the card doesn't get damaged and doesn't know or care how much plastic is around it. I purchased this because I wanted to cut my AT&T Micro-SIM card down to Nano-SIM size for an iPhone 5  but still have the option to use the Nano-SIM in the Galaxy S4 by using an adapter. Cutter:  The cutter that comes in this kit is a very good  solid quality.  It is hard metal and is built like an old fashioned metal stapler.  You put your full size SIM (or Micro SIM in an adapter) in it  press hard  and out comes a nano.  My only criticism of this product is that  since it is a PRESS  the nano SIM that comes out can be a little bit rough-around-the-edges (literally).  I used this on a T-Mobile SIM and I had to sand the edges to get rid of some burrs.  Also  a SIM card should have one corner cut diagonally so that you know which way to put it.  After using this  it was a little unclear which corner was the angled corner because the corners came out a bit rough.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417El-mNCvL._SY300_.jpg,Aerb Nano Sim Card Cutter Mini /Standard & Micro to Nano Sim for iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 5 iPhone 4  4S and other Phones + Metal Tray + 2 Sim Adapters + Sand Paper  All in One Pack

http://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Cutter-Standard-iPhone-Adapters/dp/B009P16FKY,QQ Tech Nano Sim Card Cutter,http://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Cutter-Standard-iPhone-Adapters/product-reviews/B009P16FKY, on November 13  2013,I was moving from one phone service to a discount cell phone service and had just purchased an iPhone 5S that was unlocked.  The new company that I was going with did not have nano cards yet so I needed to be able to cut down a micro sim card.  I ordered this device to accomplish that task.  Here is what I liked:   1.  The device is well made and includes all of the parts that the listing says it does.  There is a metal tray to hold the micro SIM so that you can cut it to a nano size.  You can also cut full size SIM cards to nano size.  NOTE:  No where in the product information does it claim to cut standard to micro as some other reviewers have thought.  This device makes NANO SIMS out of standard and micro SIMs.   2.  The tool is easy to use  but takes a bit of pressure to make the cut.  If you take the time to line up everything  you can get a nice cut.  They include a bit of sand paper to smooth out any rough edges.   3.  The included trays to change your nano back into a micro or regular size SIM work and allow you to move the SIM back and forth between different devices. What I did not like: Actually  there was not anything to complain about with this product.  It does exactly what it says.  It also warns you that some Micro SIMs are thicker than standard and that it could cause issues with your device after being cut if it is too thick for the tray.  I did not find any problems here  but it is probably worth checking before you cut. As normally happens  just after I got this and cut down my SIM  the company I was getting service from came out with a nano SIM.  So  you might double check with your service provider BEFORE buying this as you might not need it.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417El-mNCvL._SY300_.jpg,Aerb Nano Sim Card Cutter Mini /Standard & Micro to Nano Sim for iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 5 iPhone 4  4S and other Phones + Metal Tray + 2 Sim Adapters + Sand Paper  All in One Pack
http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/dp/B00U8KSUIG,GREAT phone  but a couple drawbacks you need to be aware of,http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/product-reviews/B00U8KSUIG, on April 23  2015,I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor  if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife  all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ░░░░░THE UPSIDES░░░░░ ❖ The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get  but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen  the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ❖ The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ❖ TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51703c6dpmL._SY300_.jpg,"Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920F 32GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) 5.1"" QHD Black - International Version"

http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/dp/B00U8KSUIG,Great update from the Galaxy SII,http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/product-reviews/B00U8KSUIG, on May 9  2015,As my name suggests  I am a college student so I mostly use my phone for texting  Facebook  Instagram and other social media. Thus I would say I'm not an intensive user of all of the phone's features. I also do not play any games on it as I prefer to use my iPad for that. That way I keep my phone's storage pretty much at less than 50%. I switched from a Galaxy SII the T-989 version two weeks ago and have never looked back. I had a 16GB microSD card on my old phone and at first was wary of not having an option for expandable storage but soon realized since the Galaxy S6 has 32GB of storage that's more than enough for me and my daily needs. Thus  the non-removal battery and lack of the microSD slot is a non-issue to me. This phone is certainly a huge upgrade for me  basically everything is different about it. My personal favorite features are the LED light which my previous phone lacked  the fingerprint scanner  and the fact that I am able to reply to a text message from any app because there are pop up notifications. Previously  I wanted to switch to the iPhone because it had those notification features like pop-up notifications and notifications on the lock screen but now that the Galaxy S6 has those too I no longer feel the need for an iPhone. As previously mentioned  I do not use my phone extensively so I've had no issues with it so far. It is smooth  responsive and fast. I haven't any issues with apps crashing or the phone freezing (knock on wood!). I also really enjoy the battery life. With my previous phone I would have to charge it twice in one day if I used it constantly  thus I resorted to using airplane mode to salvage my battery life. With this phone  I charge it every other day if I let it go from 100% to 5%. It also charges very quickly.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51703c6dpmL._SY300_.jpg,"Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920F 32GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) 5.1"" QHD Black - International Version"
http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/dp/B00U8KSUIG,The Galaxy S Evolution is Near Complete,http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920F-FACTORY-UNLOCKED/product-reviews/B00U8KSUIG, on April 6  2015,Wow  what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship)  it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet  like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7  or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year  Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors  and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both  plus some of their own. Finally  this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone  is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal  and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe  phone. The back is beautiful  the sides are beautiful - heck  even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand  and oozes style and sophistication. * The very next thing you notice  of course  is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry  hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7  and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun  and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now  they have fixed those issues  and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it  just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today.

http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Factory-Unlocked-Quad-Core-Smartphone/dp/B00KTMVBTI,Beware of the 4G LTE capability,http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Factory-Unlocked-Quad-Core-Smartphone/product-reviews/B00KTMVBTI, on July 14  2014,"Okay  if you're here you probably have made your research about the S5 so you know it's an awesome phone. I do  however  wanna talk about some aspects of this version since it's and unlocked version. First of all  yes  do you get the SM-G900F version. So don't be afraid you'll pay for that one and get a SM-G900H instead (that was one of my concerns when searching for it since a read different reviews that talked about that). Also  I read in some of the questions that it didn't came with a box; that it was new and had all of the plastics but that it didn't came with a box. False  the box is there with no signs of being opened since all of the stickers are still intact. If you compare it with the box of a phone that has been bought at a carrier  the specs list is in a different order  uses different words but in the end it's all the same. The biggest difference  I think  is the fact this one says LTE while carrier ones say 4G LTE. But then again  no big deal. However  although 4G capable  I am NOT able to get 4G signals all the time. I have an AT&T sim card and for the first days I wasn't able to get 4G at all. I then called costumer service and they updated my phone info (cause apparently the system registered it as a 2G phone rather than a 4G device) and guided me through creating the specific APN settings for AT&T's network. Sadly  even after that it didn't worked. But after that though  I started having problems with my network signal. I didn't always had all of the signal bars and my phone even started disconnecting from the network completely displaying the ""Only emergency calls"" sign. To which in many occasions I had to reboot it more than one time in order for it to get signal again. Long story short  I am now able to get 4G speeds in SOME areas for a little amount of time.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-YRnAtUxL._SY300_.jpg,Samsung Korea Galaxy S5 G900F 4G LTE 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Android Smartphone - Retail Packaging - Blue

http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower-Portable-External-Lightning-Included/dp/B00EP6OJ48,Value priced with large 8400mAh capacity,http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower-Portable-External-Lightning-Included/product-reviews/B00EP6OJ48, on January 3  2013,This is a review of the RAVPower 8400mAh Power Bank. I was provided with a free sample for evaluation. It caught my eye because of it's low price and large capacity. This is an updated version of the powerbank.  The previous version was only 7800mAh. Consequently  I  have created a new video and completely rewritten my review. It's an attractive unit and provides two USB output ports. Output 1 provides 5V/1A  while Output 2 provides 5V/2A. You'd use Output 2 for tablets  like the iPad  that can take advantage of the 2A output for faster charging. Devices that require less power can be charged on either Output port. You are able to use both outputs simultaneously to charge or operate two devices at the same time. More great features are that the PowerBank has an auto-shutoff to conserve power and has overcurrent as well as short circuit protection. It also has an LED flashlight. 2-USB to USB-micro cables are provided  each being 23 inches in length. The 4-blue LED's provide an indication of the battery status of the Power Bank. 1-light = <25% charge. 2-lights = 25-50% charge  3-lights = 50-75% charge. 4-lights = 75-100% charge. The power bank itself is charged via a micro-USB port . RAVpower  has included  a nylon mesh bag with drawstring into which everything fits with even a little room to spare. You also get a short  flat  USB to Micro USB cable and a longer  flat  USB to MicroUSB cable. 2 additional tips are provided  a MiniUSB and Samsung 30-pin. These tips plug into the MicroUSB end of either of the provided USB cables. My only issue with the PowerBank is that it is a little slower at charging my iPhone5s and iPad3 than other powerbanks or USB chargers.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Uyxeoa%2BwL._SX300_.jpg,RAVPower 8400mAh Deluxe Portable Charger(External Battery Pack  Power Bank  3A Output  Dual USB  Apple 30pin and Lightning Cable Not Included) - White

Since i'm about one of the least graceful people in the world  the minute i started my phone up  i ran home to pick out a good case for it. I had heard a lot of good things about the Defender series  and though i considered it  i knew i wouldn't be happy with having such a bulky phone. That's why i decided to check out their other models. i considered the commuter  but i read a lot of reviews that people didn't feel protected enough with it. as far as not sacrificing sleekness and still getting a working amount of protection  the Reflex Series was a no-brainer. Since buying it  i have dropped my iphone from waist height on the concrete lab floor 3 times  and even once it slipped out of my swinging hand while running on the sidewalk. NO damage  even though it bounced several times and slid a ways. This case has paid for itself already as far as i'm concerned. Another thing is that this case isn't bulky in my hand  and because it is mostly hard plastic  it doesnt add too much weight to the phone. This is good because as a girl  i like to put my phone in the back pocket of my skinny jeans so i dont want to look like ive got butt pAdding or something. one last good thing to mention about it is that the case has a felt liner inside so it doesn't scratch your phone if you are constantly taking the case off and putting it back on. It slips on and off relatively easily despite its nice snug fit! And bonus  it comes with a nice durable screen protector. That said  one con that i do have about it  and i have read other reviews with the same regret on the otterbox website  is that the cases are all designed for the black iphone  which means that the color scheme doesn't look as nice with my white one.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHu%2BhYajL._SY445_.jpg,OtterBox Reflex Series Case for iPhone 4S

http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Reflex-Series-4S-Retail-Packaging/dp/B005SUHSPW,The jury is still out,http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Reflex-Series-4S-Retail-Packaging/product-reviews/B005SUHSPW, on November 22  2011,Case appears to be strong and durable  typical of the Otterbox lineup.  I have sworn by their cases and customer support for years and this case appears to be in line with the Defender series that I had previously on my iPhone  iPad and Blackberries.  As for withstanding falls  drops  etc.  I think this case will do decently well.  Several things that I have noticed and not been exceptionally happy with are as follows.  Maybe I am too picky  who knows.  The screen protector that came with the case peeled at the corners when I tried to slide the cover on.  I followed the pictorial to the letter to place it on the phone.  You only get one shot at it  so when mine peeled up I was dead in the water.  A work around that I found was to put one side of the phone into the case and then very carefully snap the other side on and then slide the phone the rest of the way.  Second  the case is very slick.  I had hoped that there might be a bit more tack to the rubber  but there really isn't and I could see this thing slipping out of my hand when I take it out of my pocket.  My hands are generally dry and offer nothing in the tack department.  I am going to slap a couple of strategically placed pieces of grip tape on it in hopes that will make it a bit better.  The OEM charger fits snugly into the bottom to charge  not sure how it would work with a dock  but it's decently tight with the standard charger.  The gunmetal gray color is the same color as the gray box in the home button on the white iPhone  for what that's worth.  I bought the Relflex case as a streamlined replacement version of it's big brother the Defender.  The Defender was hard to slide in and out of my pocket and wearing it on my belt was clumsy.  It's protection is second to none  the Reflex favors streamline over protection.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHu%2BhYajL._SY445_.jpg,OtterBox Reflex Series Case for iPhone 4S
http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/dp/B00IZ1W8JW,The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!,http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/product-reviews/B00IZ1W8JW, on March 26  2014,"I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy  and ultimately  us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s  Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3  and several Nokia(n95-97  n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years  and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution  we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies  that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship  and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing  the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy  and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be. Now that that is out of the way  let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s  Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3  but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes  I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review): The Good: 1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone  I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen  but at its current resolution  it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight  everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen  but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0"" 1080p(440ppi) form.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AfhlzrZyL._SY445_.jpg,HTC One M8  Gunmetal Grey 32GB (Verizon Wireless)
http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/dp/B00IZ1W8JW,Incredible phone with outstanding battery life,http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/product-reviews/B00IZ1W8JW, on April 11  2014,I want to preface this review by saying I owned the original AT&T HTC One (m7)  and had I not dropped it and ruined it I would still be using it to this day. It was my favorite phone I've ever owned and it wasn't even close. I decided to wait for the release of the HTC One m8 and see how it stacked up against it's elder sibling  and for the most part it's an iterative update to the m7. That's not an insult  mind you  considering how well crafted the m7 was. The m8 is an outstanding device  and I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone. Here's a breakdown of my thoughts on the phone: --DESIGN-- Overall  this is probably the one of (if not THE) best built phones on the market. It just feels premium  and the brushed metal finish looks incredibly sleek. The metal finish is slightly slippery  but gives the phone a perfect fit in your hands. HTC decided to increase the phone size from 4.7 inches to a full 5 inches  and the difference is noticeable in both good and bad ways. The good obviously being the extra space for the gorgeous 1080p screen  the bad being just a tad too long  IMO. I thought 4.7 inches was just about a perfect fit  especially considering the power button is stationed at the top  making it difficult to reach the top when held with one hand. The edges are a little more rounded than the boxier edges of the m7  and the weight is about on par (technically slightly heavier but not noticeable). 9/10 --SCREEN-- Uses the same 1080p screen as its predecessor  which was at or near the top of its class. Still beautiful to look at  has amazing viewing angles  and is very bright. Is no better and no worse than other top smartphones  however  as QHD mobile phones are just around the corner.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AfhlzrZyL._SY445_.jpg,HTC One M8  Gunmetal Grey 32GB (Verizon Wireless)
http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/dp/B00IZ1W8JW,A Comparison to the HTC M7,http://www.amazon.com/HTC-One-M8-Gunmetal-Wireless/product-reviews/B00IZ1W8JW, on April 11  2014,I told myself repeatedly that I didn't need to get this phone  but after seeing it in person I had to upgrade to it via AT&T Next. I brought it home from the AT&T Store a few days ago and took a good look at it compared to my M7. There's several key differences between the two. - The M8 is larger than the M7. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It really is larger. It's almost unwieldy huge. My hands are reasonably large  so I have no problem with the size. However  when I did go back to my M7 for brief periods of time  I felt the screen size was very nice. - The power button is still on top. That's where I prefer it  honestly. I never liked how the Galaxy phones put it on the left side so only right-handed people will be able to hit it easily. However  the power button on the M8 is on top to the right side instead of the left. It took me some time to get used to this because the power button is on top to the left side on the M7. - Looking for the headphone jack? It used to be on top on the M7  but they moved it to the bottom next to the micro USB slot on the M8. I'm rather indifferent to this change  honestly. As long as the headphone jack still works then I'm fine with it. - The M8 has on-screen buttons this time instead of the hardware capacitive buttons from the M7. I really like this change because if there was anything I really disliked about the M7  it was how the only two buttons were back and home. After using other devices like the Nexus 7  it made more sense to have the three buttons at the bottom in some form. The M8 has them on screen like many modern Android phones. - There's a micro SD slot.

http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BD-H5100-Blu-Ray-Player-Model/dp/B00ICDAAX4,Samsung Quality Persists Throughout,http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BD-H5100-Blu-Ray-Player-Model/product-reviews/B00ICDAAX4, on April 9  2014,Being that I only really purchase Samsung televisions  picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple. I also have Amazon Prime (which I strongly suggest purchasing) and this was eligible for free shipping which was a convincing factor. The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Samsung products go. If you're unfamiliar with Samsung electronics: all remotes works for all products. That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And  indeed  this was the case. I turned it on and decided to choose the quick-start option  which allows for the player to remain in an active sleep state when not in use. When you're ready to use the player  it turns on immediately. When I say immediately  I really mean immediately. There is virtually no delay when pressing the power button on the remote for the player. I've used products with quick-start options in the past and none were as responsive as this. Next  I set up my Netflix account to be associated with the player. It didn't provide me with an access code and instead had me log in with my email and password. Fine with me; saved me the trouble of opening my laptop and whatnot. It will keep you logged in until you decide to log yourself out; this includes shutting the player off. Netflix was very responsive and I have zero issues with it still. It also has Hulu and Pandora on it but I don't use those often so I didn't bother checking them out. Overall for the price  this player is easily the best on the market right now. My one complaint is that it doesn't have wifi.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31DH6WNrLDL._SY300_.jpg,Samsung BD-H5100 Blu-Ray Disc Player (2014 Model)

http://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Case-Spigen-Slim-Armor/dp/B00I3UWGJW,perfect case for me  good value and functional.,http://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Case-Spigen-Slim-Armor/product-reviews/B00I3UWGJW, on April 9  2014,"I just received my Samsung galaxy S5 today  and had the spigen case ready to go. I've owned the Otterbox commuter for the galaxy s3 and various other cheaper silicone and knockoff cases and got to say this Spigen air cushion case is my favorite. Appearance: First off the case is sleak and slim. It is thinner than the otterboxes I've owned  and does not give much bulk to the phone. I hate when my phone is one thing  and the case completely changes the look of the phone. This case closely resembles the phone itself  and allows most of the front to be seen. People have been critical that the dots on the back are not an EXACT replica of the phone  and this is true  but it's close enough. I believe it looks better because it eliminates the Samsung S5 logo and the network provider logo. Function: Simply put  everything works great. The material covering the volume and power buttons is a stronger plastic than the silicone I've had on other cases  so the buttons sticking is not an issue. Plenty of access to the headphone jack  and the power jack is easily accessible yet protected. Fingerprint swipe is not affected by the case in the slightest. When you swipe your finger it only needs to go past the fingerprint scanner which is above the main button  far from the case which is extra thin at that point anyway. Heartrate monitor sucks. Not because of the case  just because of the phone. Tried it multiple times with and without the case  resulting in less than 50% readings with poor accuracy. I'm 6'4"" and have large fingers  but I feel I'm able to make contact with the heartrate sensor just the same with or without the case.  Honestly I wouldn't be using this feature much anyway.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513cy%2BDKd-L._SY300_.jpg,Galaxy S5 Case  Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Shimmery White (SGP10755)

I wanted the GS5 in blue but they weren't selling them by release day that I'm aware of. I'm sure they will show up someday somewhere  But I couldn't wait for them. I had to have my GS5! An upgrade from the GS2 btw!!  :) Well anyway  this case is great. I've had an Otterbox case on my GS2 since day 1  it has done well in keeping the phone safe. But every time I have had to take it off I think... wow! This phone is a lot nicer without the case on it. (that includes looks and feel) But man with this Spigen Slim Armor case it arguably looks better and feels better than the phone alone. The blue plastic outer shell looks shimmery and metallic  and really classy. The case adds virtually no size to the phone. The grip is better than expected from the plastic back shell too. Everything fits great. The fitting of the plastic shell to the under rubber armor is perfect  all the holes are centered in their respective cutouts. There is enough room to get the charging cover opened up and the cord fits easily past the case. There is plenty of room for the headphone jack. In short it's all top quality!!  ..... except one thing. As others have mentioned. As well as it all fits the phone like a glove  the fit is so good that the heart-rate sensor cutout doesn't quite leave enough room to to get a finger on the sensor. Although with my pinky turning it sideways I can get it to work. I might do what another suggested and cut out a bit more of the rubber with my Dremel to make it work better  but ultimately like the fit enough I may just live with it as it is. Well done Spigen! I couldn't expect a better case PERIOD!! BTW...",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513cy%2BDKd-L._SY300_.jpg,Galaxy S5 Case  Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Shimmery White (SGP10755)

My kids are a bit spoiled and are used to having about 80 movies available on their iPad's in the house via iTunes Sharing from my main HTPC .  We travel 6 to 8 times a year and I wanted to find a way to bring their movies with us as the internal flash storage on the iPad is very limited and they quickly tire of the same 2 movies I can squeeze on there. Our most recent trip was a 10 day vacation so I really wanted a way to bring their movies with us before we left. My equipment setup: RAVPower RP-WD02 2TB Western Digital Elements USB 3.0 portable hard drive Verizon 4G LTE MiFi 4 x Apple iPad 2 x iPhone 5 Setup for the device was really simple. I downloaded the free app from the App Store  and was able to configure the networking portion of the device very easily.  The built in web server will let you do it as well.  It recognized my WD portable HDD with no issues at all.  Setting it up was surprisingly easy and the entire time I used it  it worked perfectly.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much  I was expecting bugs  crashes  things not working  but this little box worked great! My first use for this box was to serve up the kids movies in the car.  Family lives 8 hours away  so keeping the kids entertained is a high priority on road trips.  My vehicle has a 110V outlet in it  and I plugged in my Anker 40W 5 port USB charger into it to keep all the gadgets powered.  I  used it to keep 2 iPads charged  power the RAVPower FileHub  and a Verizon MiFi.  I picked up 2 6ft Amazon USB extension cords to give the lightning cables extra reach to the kids in the back seat.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qxAkAvszL._SY300_.jpg,RAVPower All-In-One FileHub Wireless N Travel Router USB Micro SD SDXC TF Memory Card Reader Card with 6000 mAh portable charger USB Hard drive Flash Mobile Storage Media Sharing for iOS &android devices

The RP-WD02 is the 2nd revision of RavPower's FileHub. The first model which is currently still available on Amazon is the RP-WD01  there are some similarities between the two devices but the RP-WD02 seems to be an upgraded device with additional features. Main differences between the RavPower FileHub RP-WD02 and the older Ravpower FileHub RP-WD01: - 6000 mAh internal battery versus 3000 mAh internal battery in the previous model - Micro SD slot versus SD slot in the previous model - Ethernet port added to the newer model The best feature about the FileHub in my opinion is the ability to access and transfer files on storage devices wirelessly  whether it be from a micro SD card  flash drive or hard drive (portable or desktop). I have multiple devices both IOS and Android and it becomes time consuming to have to transfer devices from my computer to each device  with the FileHub I can just have the file on storage and access or transfer the file wirelessly via the FileHub.

Therefore I shopped Amazon to save $10 or more over my local Office Max and also have a greater selection to replace my old computer speakers and started with a CA two piece that looked slick but uncharacteristically were awful. Great thing about Amazon  easy free returns and exchanges so I stepped up to these and have been very pleased. I will simply say this; I am a musician with a very picky ear for sound. I do not like to listen to any music on anything that is not high-end quality. The first pair of speakers I ever bought as an Adult for my home sound system was a pair of ADS Speakers that in 1988 cost $700 (I was a kid).  Speakers make your system  period. My review of these is simple; if you are wanting  to save some cash and/or have a regular sized office you will love these speakers for several reasons: They sound great up to a more than reasonable high-end Volume and Bass setting without distortion that is plenty loud enough to piss off your office or house mates (or the spouse) and possibly even your neighbors and they have a few simple but very nice extra features.  The peak sound is very high but doesn't sound good  however  if you need this much volume you need to spend a few hundred dollars and look elsewhere. BOTTOM LINE: This system rocks and has great sound. Nice Features: The sound wheel which you can set on your desk and allows you to turn the speakers on and off with I personally love.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dXOzbcycL._SX300_.jpg,Cyber Acoustics 30 Watt Powered Speakers with Subwoofer for PC and Gaming Systems in Frustration Free Packaging  (CA-3602FFP)

It will certainly be good enough to do regular day-to-day stuff. Just don’t become a high graphic gamer or anything  or you will pay the consequences.  The All in one’s are nice looking and don’t take up much room and it looks sleek and nice on the desk.  It's footprint is about as small as it gets  maybe even smaller than a laptop to some degree.  I like the fact that it’s got 500gigs of hard drive space which should be more than enough for me.  Windows 8.1 is better since its customized like a Windows 7  & 8 PC. Some of the bad things are = Intel Celeron processor.  *these are the weakest type of processors you can get. 4Gigs of SDRAM   you could be able to upgrade to 8 or 12 depending on compatibility.  I don't plan to since I am not an I.T. guru and don't need to. So..this product out of the box took some time to get up and running because Dell support asks if you want to allow it to upgrade.  I chose yes.  That process took 2.5 hrs to do it's thing.  You can skip this and come back to it...I didn't.  I didn't think it was going to take so long.  Just getting a new pc  one tends to want to ""play"" right away....so fair warning you may wish to skip and return to this.  I didn't skip because I didn't know how easy it would be to navigate back to this option.  Because I didn't skip this  I can't tell you how to navigate back to it either. Yesterday I sat and used the computer for 3 hours.  I downloaded some free app's to see how it worked out.  The app market appears the same as my android phone market.  (Android..not Iphone)  I love that some things were pre-loaded.  Email  facebook etc.  However  you are forced to utilize your Microsoft account to set everything up.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XNl8FcJLL._SX300_.jpg,Dell Inspiron i3043-1250BLK 19.5-Inch All-in-One Desktop

It comes shipped with Windows 8  McAfee Live Safe (antivirus/internet security  30 day license).  Suprisingly  it has almost no bloatware... it comes with some Dell utilities (backup  etc.) but aside from that  its pretty empty.  (This is a Really Good Thing(tm)) I'm an expert computer user  I'm a software engineer by trade going to school for Information Assurance (Computer Security/Hacking/etc.) and outside of that  I've had ~15yrs of experience building/deploying home computers and laptops. The computer is a single 19.5"" LED screen with a kick-stand.  The stand seems sturdy enough for me  and doesn't look like it would be easy to break unless that was your purpose.  Setup was simple:  Kitchen table?  Check!  Plug in the wall?  Check.  Mouse and keyboard into USB ports?  Check! That's it! When first starting the machine  it popped up with a UEFI test application (replaces BIOS) and I *really* appreciated that the first-boot put the system through a rigorous memory and processor test.  Due to the hardware  the full test took well over an hour and a half to complete as it chugged through everything on the system.  After it passed  we boot Windows 8. After installing malwarebytes  I figured I'd do an informal benchmark by running a full scan.  It scanned ~280k objects in 25:38. Not exactly respectable  BUT considering the hardware--Dual core celeron with a 5400rpm hard drive  not exactly surprising. What really shocked the hell out of me is how good the sound is from such a budget machine.  The speakers actually have a very respectable range  and don't sound particularly tinny  though don't expect good bass response.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XNl8FcJLL._SX300_.jpg,Dell Inspiron i3043-1250BLK 19.5-Inch All-in-One Desktop

http://www.amazon.com/NZXT-Technologies-Kraken-Cooling-RL-KRX61-01/dp/B00L0YLJJG,Best AIO on the market with a few software quirks,http://www.amazon.com/NZXT-Technologies-Kraken-Cooling-RL-KRX61-01/product-reviews/B00L0YLJJG, on August 7  2014,Great cooler  and just what I was looking for! It is very quiet and the fans included are very quiet as well (surprisingly). The installation was very simple and way easier than my antec 1250; which was the worst installation I have ever done btw. And also better than the antec is the sound level as I mentioned before. The 1250 is a great cooler and keeps temps down  but it was just too loud with two pumps and not so great fans.   The x61 is the best cooler I have used and I will definitely be keeping it for a very long time  but there are a few tiny kink in the software that need to be worked out. For example  the led control is not very good: it doesn't always update your changes on the fly (like it should)  it doesn't allow for brightness adjustment  the 'breathing' mode is the weirdest thing because it doesn't fade in and out smoothly  like a breathing mode does on keyboards  it actually changes from white to blue to red and then back again. Lastly  for some reason the LED on the block stays on even when my PC is turned off and is really annoying since it is in my bedroom. Hopefully all of these things can be fixed with an update to the CAM software (which is the best looking software for coolers). I am not deducting any stars because these are just cosmetic quirks that can easily be fixed.   There are a few things that NZXT could improve on: the biggest thing is the fan design  meaning the 'open' stylized design of the plastic housing does not seal completely against the radiator  so the 3rd version of the fans need to be completely square and all closed in  please. And the instruction need a little more detail. It is not a hard kit to figure out  but the screws need to be labelled and the actual instructions should tell you which ones you need to use.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HNY3GL4eL._SY300_.jpg,NZXT Technologies Kraken X61 280mm All-in-One Liquid Cooling System RL-KRX61-01

I reposted the original review but it's without some of the edits. If you have any questions about this product please let me know! I keep this review as up to date as possible Recommendation: Mount it! I used the Acer for 3 months on the desk and decided to pick up a cheap VESA mount from Amazon ($20). Two screws later my monitor/tablet has new life. I love it mounted  so much so that i'm bumping this to 5 stars from 4. End update:::: Oh boy this is frustrating. I came on Amazon to check some reviews out on the Acer All-in-one to find a pretty bad average rating. The first 15 reviews I read was uninformative and from the uninformed. No offense to the people that purchased this and gave it a bad review  okay a little offense. Nothing frustrates me more than reviews knocking a product because the purchaser DIDN'T READ THE SPECS. Are you telling me that you paid $200+ for something without reading the functions of the product? Shame on you. This is basically an oversized tablet. This is not a computer and it will not function as such. Let me get a few things straight before I go into a summary: 1) This is not a computer. It runs Andriod. You will not have the windows experience. There are other All-in-ones (like the HP Slate) that will suit your needs better if you're looking to fill the needs of a computer. 2) Ebay currently sells this model brand new for $180  directly form Acer. Go to Dealnews and search for this model  they have the link. I can't say how long it will be on sale for but I can tell you that I hopped all over this deal.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ROPoKTQVL._SX300_.jpg,Acer DA220HQL 21.5-Inch Android All-in-One Touchscreen Desktop 2013 Model

On the account of some less than great reviews I hesitated to purchase this  but let me tell you  as a very ""tech person""  the poor reviews are unfounded and authored by people who simply were disappointed that this does not have Windows installed which it does not claim to! You can however plug in your Windows laptop  tablet. tower  etc  and have a full blown huge Windows tablet/touchscreen all-in-one! The screen is beautiful I must mention; it's full HD and crisp - I can't take anyone with issues with the screen seriously and hopefully you won't either. My only disappointment was that I did not get this sooner! Android OS works much better in a desktop manner than I thought it would. Mind you we got this mainly for the kids to use android  and secondly as a monitor solution to get a desktop experience from our smaller Windows tablets. It really works great for all of this and unlike many other ""portable all-in-ones""  this unit actually is absolutely portable! For $299  I honestly expected less  but feel I got well more than my money's worth with this product - VERY HAPPY. ****PROS**** ~This unit is truly portable! It's very thin  light-weight  sleek  and just very attractive and high quality all around. ~The included keyboard and mouse are very nice - they have a uniqueness in their design that is refreshing. ~Crisp  clear  FULL HD touch-screen. ~Micro to full HDMI cable & micro to full size USB are included in the box. ~Works as a touch screen monitor for any (even non-touch screen) Windows machines. ~Adjustable built-in kickstand works great and is much lighter and less bulky than other 'stands' on all-in-ones.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ROPoKTQVL._SX300_.jpg,Acer DA220HQL 21.5-Inch Android All-in-One Touchscreen Desktop 2013 Model
http://www.amazon.com/Acer-DA220HQL-21-5-Inch-Android-Touchscreen/dp/B00CHYKVPQ,Good idea updates will go a long way to making it better.,http://www.amazon.com/Acer-DA220HQL-21-5-Inch-Android-Touchscreen/product-reviews/B00CHYKVPQ, on August 31  2013,I bought this device several months ago. I have mixed feelings about it. Like similar devices it has it's pros and cons. Lets start with the Pros: The monitor is quite attractive. The colours are bright and vivid  contrary to the views of another reviewer. The touch screen is very good albeit only two point.The mouse and keyboard works well  although I find the mouse to be too small. If you have big hands the discomfort of holding the mouse is quite noticeable. My solution was to ditch the mouse and opt for a good mouse. Now this is where this monitor really shines  windows 8  attached to my Windows 8 laptop it is really nice. Now the cons: The screen does show some graininess as mentioned by another reviewer. This screen seems not even to be a true touch screen  it's more of an optical screen. The screen has this silvery look that resmbles the old cathode ray monitors which I think takes away from the overall look of the monitor. When the monitor is on it is okay   when it is off that is when you get that sort of retro appearance. The biggest problem with the monitor is with windows 8  the monitor has a frame around the mask so closing an app in windows 8 can only be done with the mouse. Those of you with windows 8 touch screens know what I mean. Conclusion : As an Android tablet it is mediocre as it is currently  even though it runs ICS. There are a lot of apps that won't even install  there are others that will install but won't fit the screen format. Flipboard is one that comes to mind. It will be nice to see a firmware update to remedy such problems. As an external monitor it gets an A. I see it priced on some sites for as much as 500 dollars. One of the other reviewer said that she paid 599.00 I paid 499.00. This monitor is worth just what Amazon sells it for.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ROPoKTQVL._SX300_.jpg,Acer DA220HQL 21.5-Inch Android All-in-One Touchscreen Desktop 2013 Model

I have a large 2 car garage with only one car in it  the rest is used for lawn stuff and storage since I have no basement and little room in the attic. There was generally no problem with the side room when parked. But even than on occasion I had to move my vehicle for extra door clearance. My main problem was my SUV is fairly long  which does not leave much room in the front and rear when parked. My main concern was the back since I have a automatic garage door. But since I got this set up  there is no need to walk back to make sure the garage door is going to close without hitting my vehicle. There where two things that had to be corrected on the Park N Place. One was where the antenna pole goes into the base. There fit was loose and the pole would lean to one side or another. I wrapped a piece of a paper hand towel around the lower part of the pole and shoved it into the hole. Just like magic the pole stood up straight and erect. "" No Viagra Needed Here "".  The other problem is the base is to light and tends to move when you bump the pole a little harder than a slight nudge. I pretty much cured that by placing three round cement sprinkler head rings over the pole and resting on the base. These rings weigh about a pound and 1/2 or so each  and can be bought for a $1 or $2 at Home Depot. Of course you can use anything heavy  like bricks or a cinder block. These rings just happen to look nice and neat. ( Check out my photo under customer images on the product page ) After the adjustments that I made this thing works great.

http://www.amazon.com/Streetwise-Security-Products-Protector-000-volt/dp/B00IWAY1MI,Battery seems to be dead or stun portion is dead after a week!,http://www.amazon.com/Streetwise-Security-Products-Protector-000-volt/product-reviews/B00IWAY1MI, on March 31  2015,I only got this product today  and I am writing this review because so far it is so good. First off  the flashlight is very bright! In fact it is brighter than the LED on their 7.5 million volt Touchdown stun gun. I bought a second stun gun as a backup  and also for my smaller purse (when I am not taking out my big purse). One downside to the flashlight on this device is that you do need to keep holding down the button for it to light up (I wish they would have just added a toggle switch instead). Normally people won't be able to write much of a stun gun review (especially on the first day)  but anyways I actually got to test it a tiny bit today (by accident). Obviously after testing out the flashlight  I decided to test the stun feature. This is when I accidentally got to test the shock this thing gives. Even though the shock button was no longer depressed  there was a still a tiny bit of residual electricity left on the prongs and it shocked my pinky. (So when you get this product  DO NOT TOUCH THE PRONGS AFTER TESTING! WAIT AT LEAST 1-2 SECONDS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SHOCKED!!!) Even though it was just residual electricity  it hurt like heck! My hand instantaneously pulled back before I even had the time to figure out what happened. My pinky continued to feel slightly numb  tiny bit of pain  and felt weak for another 10-15 minutes. All this from just a tiny residual shock! Can you imagine what it will be like getting hit with thing full force? Because of this  I am giving this product a 4/5 star review and I also feel a lot safer with this. I am taking 1 star off because there are some flaws to the device. The product could have some room for improvement. They could add a charge controller to this.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cyWBfHa4L._SX300_.jpg,Streetwise Security Products Streetwise Perfume Protector 3 500 000-volt Stun Gun  Pink

About the length of a lighter  but a bit wider  and thicker  it is basically just large enough to house the two AA batteries you need to install.  Just slide off the battery cover  and in they go  and PRESTO  you have a fake (but realistic looking -- for the most part) car ""alarm"" system that you can turn on and off  place where you want it  and use when you choose. I looked at all of the others out there  before deciding on this one  and I chose this one mainly because it doesn't require being ""wired"" into your car  takes readily available batteries  and also because it seemed to get the best reviews (others were noted for being flimsy  falling apart easily  or looking fake because of either the style of the light inside  or the big ""on/off"" words written on the side). This one does have a velcro patch  which is meant for a permanent mount option -- stick one side of the velcro where you want the device to be  and then you can attach (or remove) the device as needed.  However  because it is flat  I like that I don't need to bother with the velcro -- I can just set it where I want it.  It does have an on/off switch  but it's pretty tiny and not easily seen in the dark of the car  at night. I have a secure garage  where I live  so I don't use it there  but it's being out and about that's sometimes a worry  depending on the neighborhood or area  and I've always known that any deterrent encourages thieves to look elsewhere.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410F%2BUs4v6L._SX300_.jpg,The Club SA110 Vehicle Anti-Theft Alert Signal and Decal Combo Set

I have reviewed several of Poweradd’s products and love their packaging  which is dummy proof  cause it lets you know the most pertinent features of the product. The charger is supported by a Li-on battery at 18.5 watts/h. It has the standard USB 5 volts/1 amp input and output. And the device reminds me of a mini perfume bottle measuring 3.94x1.28x1.20 inches. It is indeed something small enough to carry around in a pocket and not prove to be a nuisance or eyesore. The product as other Poweradd products seem to have a strong appearance with its sky blue/baby blue color. The charging cable is about eighteen inches and is made of a strong material that appears to be very flexible if it happens to bend in your purse or pockets. I am always worried that most cables that chargers come with normally have flimsy or thin cables  but I prefer having a thick wiring/coating so there’s no loss in functionality. There is a power button near the top of the battery charger  while clicking it will show the remaining juice in the charger. It has 4 bright blue dots  so that it is easy to tell whether its half charged/fully charged etc. And the light indicators is surrounded by the usb port and the micro usb connector. Poweradd really does go far and beyond the normal external battery pack form factor  because just having it on my desk makes it almost seem like a knick knack. A possible improvement that would be interesting would be to have dual chargers even on smaller juice devices  I know that may not be feasible since most smaller mAh battery chargers are meant for personal use and not to be shared among many.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BIjLrvrUL._SY300_.jpg,Poweradd™ Slim2 5000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Pack Power Bank for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S 4  iPod (Apple Adapters Not Included)  Samsung Galaxy S6 S5 S4 Note 4 3 2  LG  HTC One(M9)  Nokia  Motorola  Blackberry More Other Phones and Tablets - Rose Red

Inside the box you get the Omaker 5V / 6.6A USB 3 Port Car Charger only. Received for review this product is made of very high quality material that is fit for purpose. It's well built  elegant and stylish. The thinner section that fits into your car cigarette charger port is made of gloss black plastic whilst the wider port area is made of a material that resembles silver and enhances its overall look significantly. With 3 different ports to choose from (2.1A  2.1A  2.4A) there is ample room for all the devices that you have in the car (1-5 people). The distance between each port is adequate for most devices. It's relatively small size (about the size of your thumb in length and width) enables it to be placed directly into your car USB connection port without impeding on your driving abilities. After I connected the product to the car charging port a blue LED light appeared on the device which indicated that the product was active and was waiting for the first device. After I tested a number of different devices that we have in our home on the product in a number of different varying combinations (iPhone 4s  iPhone 5  Galaxy S2/S3/S4  iPad Mini  iPad2  iPad3 and Galaxy Note 3) I found that charging was initiated as quickly as it does when plugged directly into the mains. With the car engine and CD player running at full blast  the devices were charged at an impressive speed that was quicker than I have seen with similar products.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FekYryToL._SY300_.jpg,[Most Powerful Car Charger Ever]Omaker Intelligent 6.6A / 33W Premium Aluminum 3 USB Car Charger With Smart Sharing IC for Each USB Port-Tarnish

http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/dp/B00N1AG1RC,Not thrilled... *Updated*,http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/product-reviews/B00N1AG1RC, on September 20  2014,I always use OtterBox Defenders  let me start with that. This particular case has me reconsidering. Here are my issues with this case so far: 1) The volume buttons now require considerable effort to use. Simply pressing them will do nothing  you really need to dig in. 2) The screen protector doesn't actually sit against the screen  so using it comes with sound effects now. 3) The screen protector is actually preventing fluid movement on my screen. I have to apply more pressure than usual  probably because of the aforementioned gap. 4) The TouchID feature now only works maybe half the time. 5) The port cover for the headphone jack is only half covered. They left a sufficient space for the noise canceling mic  but if covering those ports is a priority you may take issue with this. I'm hoping to adjust to this case since I love the protection offered by OtterBox Defenders. We'll see if I feel the need to update this review after it's been on for a week or two. **UPDATED 9/25/2014** 1) I've basically stopped using these buttons. It's ridiculous. 2 & 3) The sound effects have stopped  but the screen simply does not work as well with the built in screen protector. 4) I attempted to set up my fingerprints with the case on the phone  hoping that would resolve the TouchID issues. Unfortunately  there is sufficient interference that I was not even able to set up a new print. 5) Obviously the jack cover hasn't changed. At this point I have not made any alterations to the case since I'm trying to review it as-is. I think a lot of the problems stem from a lousy fit. The cutouts on the hard plastic are not located correctly  which may be worsening the difficulties that come from the overly stiff silicon.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X-%2BjJITQL._SY300_.jpg,OtterBox iPhone 6 Case - Defender Series  Frustration-Free Packaging - Moroccan Sky  (4.7 inch)
http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/dp/B00N1AG1RC,Otterbox fell short with this case. *UPDATED - 1/4/15*,http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/product-reviews/B00N1AG1RC, on September 20  2014,"I've always been the ""s"" upgrade guy. Way back since the 3Gs I've always done the ""upgrade every two years"" thing. Because of that I've always had the luck to have an entire year for Otterbox to perfect their iPhone Defender cases. Any imperfections they found in the initial launch of the iPhone 3G  iPhone 4  iPhone 5 cases would be worked out by the time the iPhone 3Gs  iPhone 4s  and iPhone 5s cases came out. I enjoyed that little bit of (if not unscientific or rational) breathing room. This year was the first year I upgraded early  so I was curious to see if Otterbox would make a perfect case with the launch of a new iPhone model. Unfortunately they haven't. They have made an ""OK"" case  but it has one major flaw that they need to fix fast and numerous tiny flaws that I'll just have tolerate. The fingerprint sensor is the major flaw. On the 5s case there is a cutout to place your finger so there was nothing between your skin and the sensor. And the technology worked perfectly. With the iPhone 6 case there is a thin plastic shield over it and it doesn't work AT ALL. How in the world did this even pass testing!? I've been sitting here while I write this review testing it over and over again thinking it might be my finger (haha). No. The plastic over the sensor is a MAJOR hinderance to the use of this phone. And seeing how heavily Apple Pay is being touted as well as the opening of the touch sensor to third party developers  that is reason enough to not buy this case. Now I did notice that when I took the case off  the plastic covering that is over the fingerprint sensor almost looked like it was placed there as an afterthought.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X-%2BjJITQL._SY300_.jpg,OtterBox iPhone 6 Case - Defender Series  Frustration-Free Packaging - Moroccan Sky  (4.7 inch)
http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/dp/B00N1AG1RC,WARNING: Many aftermarket charge accessories will not fit the narrow Lightning port access,http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-iPhone-Case-Frustration-Free-Packaging/product-reviews/B00N1AG1RC, on September 20  2014,The OtterBox defender series is pound for pound one of the best ways to protect your iPhone. There is no disputing the two piece hard case with soft rubberized outershell and built in screen protector is an excellent way to keep your iPhone 6 protected. The Defender Series has been my go to on every iPhone I have owned for ultimate protection. I'm currently on my fourth iPhone model but this is the first OtterBox Defender that I have decided it is not the case I will be using to protect my iPhone. When you've purchased previous OtterBox products to protect your iPhone it's easy to grab the OtterBox Defender knowing it will do the job to protect your iPhone 6 and this one is no different. However this particular OtterBox Defender case has disappointed me. Yes it's got the same protection no worries there but I have noticed a change in the way the covers protect inputs such as your Lightning connector. It is considerably difficult to open the charger-flap one handed and the charger access is limited to the Apple OEM Lightning charger or the like from a size perspective. I personally have purchased Amazon Basic brand Lightning charge cords for my iPhone. I appreciate the Amazon Basic Lightning cable which is available in a increased length 6 foot cord length and it is simply better built. My OEM Apple Lighting cables always prematurely wear out and are more expensive. I have found some better aftermarket cables like the Amazon Basic Lighting cable which offer a more heavy duty sheathing and I slightly thicker lightning port connector which provide far better durability. However because the molded lightning plug is slightly larger it will NOT fit in the new OtterBox iPhone 6 Defender Series hard case molding.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X-%2BjJITQL._SY300_.jpg,OtterBox iPhone 6 Case - Defender Series  Frustration-Free Packaging - Moroccan Sky  (4.7 inch)

I also use the Q8 model.  Once you get used to them 'sucking in' - the best way to describe it as they seal around your ear to nullify or mute outside sound. I have stayed away from Bluetooth devices  as a whole  since their introduction into the market. I am shocked at the quality of these headphones.  I expected something better than the mass produced garbage in `impulse racks' but something moderately okay due to the low-cost Bluetooth.  What I got literally  figuratively speaking  stunned me. I initially had issues with these on an Android phone - they did not sound good.  Then I paired the headphones with an iPhone. Perfect operation and deep bass while streaming audio.  I went back online  and found the Droid solution from 2013.  It was my device (clearing the Bluetooth data).  Gave it a go and everything is all good. I'm impressed. I don't take much of anything seriously  but I am an audio snob. I've tossed many free or almost free headphones as I wouldn't even let my kids use them (they are audio snobs in the making). I figured these would be `okay' as a backup and I'd stick with my corded Bose.  I will now keep my Bose as backups in my gym bag since they are still quality gear and don't require a charge. If you decide to purchase these  I encourage you to test out the small  medium  and large covers that are included.  It ships with medium attached and the rest in a bag. Obviously go with the ones that feel the most comfortable - just tilt your head side to side. If they start to slip out at all  rotate the back piece. If they continue  then try the next size up. With anything  I will circle back if I have significant issues.,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314nXk%2B-z6L._SX300_.jpg,Soundpeats Qy7 V4.1 Bluetooth Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo Sports/running & Gym/exercise Bluetooth Earbuds Headphones Headsets W/microphone for Iphone 5s 5c 4s 4  Ipad 2 3 4 New Ipad  Ipod  Android  Samsung Galaxy  Smart Phones Bluetooth Devices (Black/green)

http://www.amazon.com/CF10285-Fresh-Breeze-Cabin-Filter/dp/B001CEG90I,Not good OEM filter replacement,http://www.amazon.com/CF10285-Fresh-Breeze-Cabin-Filter/product-reviews/B001CEG90I, on January 21  2014,"Purchased initially as a inexpensive replacement for a 2 year old OEM filter - 87139-YZZ1 (Toyota Prius 2011). It was I think in August or September of 2013  and prior to purchase  I was constantly fighting with that smell comping from air conditioner. So  this new FRAM CF10285 Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filter stopped the smell. Kind of  since it came back just a few weeks later  and I do not drive every day (just a few trips a week to the beach  summertime). And please note  there is no scent of any kind added to FRAM filter  so ""Fresh Breeze"" must mean just clean odorless air. Obviously  not with FRAM. Oh  and I was so exited first few days after I replaced the filter that I ordered two more just to have then ready for next year. The fall came and went its way  so we've said ""Hello"" to cold NY winter  at least 2013/2014. That's when the real problem began. The real problem is (like many other reviewers here noticed  I wish I've read all the reviews before ordering new untested product) that FRAM filter is not 100% copy of OEM filter. It uses different material  the weight is different (it is a bit heavier)  it is slightly thicker and there are half of the ribs than there are on OEM Toyota 87139-YZZ1 filter. One may think that it is a good thing but it is exactly opposite. FRAM filter is not letting the air passing thru the filter go same way as it goes via OEM filter. As a result  I had to raise the fan speed 1-2 notches up just to keep the temperature inside at the same level as a year ago with OEM filter (during the summer when I first installed FRAM I haven't paid enough attention to airflow since my air conditioning was set on AUTO). The biggest problem came with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S78bW9RSL._SX300_.jpg,FRAM CF10285 Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filter
http://www.amazon.com/CF10285-Fresh-Breeze-Cabin-Filter/dp/B001CEG90I,It's okay  but reduces air-flow,http://www.amazon.com/CF10285-Fresh-Breeze-Cabin-Filter/product-reviews/B001CEG90I, on August 30  2013,I used it on a 2007 Camry. Easy to replace  fits perfectly. I paid attention to the arrow for air direction - which is down for this one vs factory ones that simply point upward. The quality of filtering is fine. It's a filter  it works and you can tell that it's working. But my biggest disappointment was that it reduced the air-flow noticeably compared to the dealer (factory) installed filters. I strongly suspect it has to do with a smaller surface area (as observed through fewer folds) compared to the factory filter like another reviewer noticed. To give you a sense of how much the air flow is reduced  just think about the dial that controls the fan speed in the middle of the car. With this filter I get the same level of airflow at any given fan speed  that I used to get at one level below. It's not too much of a problem because I almost never used to have it at the maximum speed to begin with anyway. (So I just have to go one level higher to compensate). In that sense this product is good enough  but I wish they matched the capacity of the factory filter. I would definitely be willing to pay more for a product like that. I am not sure I will buy this one again. Edit March 2015 Based on the (well meaning) comments this review keeps getting that perhaps I put in the filter in the opposite direction  let me just add a few claims about filter air flow (based on my understanding as an engineer. You are welcome to do your own research).,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S78bW9RSL._SX300_.jpg,FRAM CF10285 Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filter
